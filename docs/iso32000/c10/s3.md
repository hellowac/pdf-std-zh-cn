**Conversions among Device Colour Spaces**

## 10.3.1 概述

**General**

=== "中文"

    Each raster output device has a *native colour space*, which typically is one of the standard device colour spaces (**DeviceGray**, **DeviceRGB**, or **DeviceCMYK**). In other words, most devices support reproduction of colours according to a grayscale (monochrome), *RGB* (red-green-blue), or *CMYK* (cyan-magenta-yellow-black) model. If the device supports continuous-tone output, reproduction shall occur directly. Otherwise, it shall be accomplished by means of halftoning.
    
    A device’s native colour space is also called its process colour model. Process colours are ones that are produced by combinations of one or more standard process colorants. Colours specified in any device or CIE- based colour space shall be rendered as process colours. A device may also support additional spot colorants, which shall be painted only by means of **Separation** or **DeviceN** colour spaces. They shall not be involved in the rendering of device or CIE-based colour spaces, nor shall they be subject to the conversions described in the Note.
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
        Some devices provide a native colour space that is not one of the three named previously but consists of a different combination of colorants. In that case, conversion from the standard device colour spaces to the device’s native colour space may be performed by the conforming reader in a manner of its own choosing.
    
    Knowing the native colour space and other output capabilities of the device, the conforming reader shall automatically convert the colour values specified in a file to those appropriate for the device’s native colour space. If the file specifies colours directly in the device’s native colour space, no conversions shall be performed.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE"
    
        If a file specifies colours in the **DeviceRGB** colour space but the device supports grayscale (such as a monochrome display) or *CMYK* (such as a colour printer), the conforming reader shall perform the necessary conversions.
    
    The algorithms used to convert among device colour spaces are very simple. As perceived by a human viewer, these conversions produce only crude approximations of the original colours. More sophisticated control over colour conversion may be achieved by means of CIE-based colour specification and rendering. Additionally, device colour spaces may be remapped into CIE-based colour spaces (see [8.6.5.6], "Default Colour Spaces").

## 10.3.2 DeviceGray 与 DeviceRGB 之间的转换

**Conversion between DeviceGray and DeviceRGB**

=== "中文"

    Black, white, and intermediate shades of gray can be considered special cases of RGB colour. A grayscale value shall be described by a single number: 0.0 corresponds to black, 1.0 to white, and intermediate values to different gray levels.
    
    A gray level shall be equivalent to an RGB value with all three components the same. In other words, the RGB colour value equivalent to a specific gray value shall be
    
    $$
    \begin{align} 
      red  &= gray \\
      green &= gray \\
      blue &= gray 
    \end{align}
    $$
    
    The gray value for a given RGB value shall be computed according to the NTSC video standard, which
    determines how a colour television signal is rendered on a black-and-white television set:
    
    $$
    gray = 0.3 × red + 0.59 × green + 0.11 × blu
    $$

## 10.3.3 DeviceGray 与 DeviceCMYK 之间的转换

**Conversion between DeviceGray and DeviceCMYK**

=== "中文"

    Nominally, a gray level is the complement of the black component of *CMYK*. Therefore, the *CMYK* colour value equivalent to a specific gray level shall be
    
    $$
    \begin{align} 
      cyan &= 0.0 \\
      magenta &= 0.0 \\
      yellow &= 0.0 \\
      black &= 1.0 - gray
    \end{align}
    $$
    
    To obtain the equivalent gray level for a given CMYK value, the contributions of all components shall be taken into account:
    
    $$
    gray = 1.0 – min(1.0, 0.3 \times cyan + 0.59 \times magenta + 0.11 \times yellow + black)

## 10.3.4 从 DeviceRGB 到 DeviceCMYK 的转换

**Conversion from DeviceRGB to DeviceCMYK**

=== "中文"

    Conversion of a colour value from *RGB* to *CMYK* is a two-step process. The first step shall be to convert the red-green-blue value to equivalent cyan, magenta, and yellow components. The second step shall be to generate a black component and alter the other components to produce a better approximation of the original colour.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        The subtractive colour primaries cyan, magenta, and yellow are the complements of the additive primaries red, green, and blue.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE"
    
        A cyan ink subtracts the red component of white light. In theory, the conversion is very simple:
        
        $$
        \begin{align} 
          cyan &= 1.0 – red \\
          magenta &= 1.0 – green \\
          yellow &= 1.0 – blue
        \end{align}
        $$
        
        A colour that is 0.2 red, 0.7 green, and 0.4 blue can also be expressed as 1.0 − 0.2 = 0.8 cyan, 1.0 − 0.7 = 0.3 magenta, and 1.0 − 0.4 = 0.6 yellow.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        Logically, only cyan, magenta, and yellow are needed to generate a printing colour. An equal level of cyan, magenta, and yellow should create the equivalent level of black. In practice, however, coloured printing inks do not mix perfectly; such combinations often form dark brown shades instead of true black. To obtain a truer colour rendition on a printer, true black ink is often substituted for the mixed-black portion of a colour. Most colour printers support a black component (the *K* component of *CMYK*). Computing the quantity of this component requires some additional steps:
        
        *Black generation* calculates the amount of black to be used when trying to reproduce a particular colour.
        
        *Undercolor removal* reduces the amounts of the cyan, magenta, and yellow components to compensate for the amount of black that was added by black generation.
    
    The complete conversion from RGB to CMYK shall be as follows, where BG (k) and UCR (k) are invocations of the black-generation and undercolor-removal functions, respectively:
    
    $$
    \begin{align} 
    c &= 1.0 – red \\
    m &= 1.0 – green \\
    y &= 1.0 – blue \\
    k &= min (c, m, y) 
    \end{align}
    $$
    
    $$
    \begin{align} 
    cyan &= min (1.0 , max ( 0.0 , c – UCR (k) ) ) \\
    magenta &= min (1.0 , max ( 0.0 , m – UCR (k) ) ) \\
    yellow &= min (1.0 , max ( 0.0 , y – UCR (k) ) ) \\
    black &= min (1.0 , max ( 0.0 , BG (k) ) ) 
    \end{align}
    $$
    
    The black-generation and undercolor-removal functions shall be defined as PDF function dictionaries (see [7.10], "Functions") that are parameters in the graphics state. They shall be specified as the values of the **BG** and **UCR** (or **BG2** and **UCR2**) entries in a graphics state parameter dictionary (see [Table 58]). Each function shall be called with a single numeric operand and shall return a single numeric result.
    
    The input of both the black-generation and undercolor-removal functions shall be k, the minimum of the intermediate *c*, *m*, and *y* values that have been computed by subtracting the original red, green, and blue components from 1.0.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 3"
    
        Nominally, k is the amount of black that can be removed from the cyan, magenta, and yellow components and substituted as a separate black component.
    
    The black-generation function shall compute the black component as a function of the nominal k value. It may simply return its k operand unchanged, or it may return a larger value for extra black, a smaller value for less black, or 0.0 for no black at all.
    
    The undercolor-removal function shall compute the amount to subtract from each of the intermediate c, m, and y values to produce the final cyan, magenta, and yellow components. It may simply return its k operand unchanged, or it may return 0.0 (so that no colour is removed), some fraction of the black amount, or even a negative amount, thereby adding to the total amount of colorant.
    
    The final component values that result after applying black generation and undercolor removal should be in the range 0.0 to 1.0. If a value falls outside this range, the nearest valid value shall be substituted automatically without error indication.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 4"
    
        This substitution is indicated explicitly by the *min* and *max* operations in the preceding formulas.
    
    The correct choice of black-generation and undercolor-removal functions depends on the characteristics of the output device. Each device shall be configured with default values that are appropriate for that device.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 5"
    
        See [11.7.5], "Rendering Parameters and Transparency" and, in particular, [11.7.5.3], "Rendering Intent and Colour Conversions" for further discussion of the role of black-generation and undercolor-removal functions in the transparent imaging model.
