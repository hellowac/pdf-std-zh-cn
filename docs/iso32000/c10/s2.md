**CIE-Based Colour to Device Colour**

=== "中文"

    To render CIE-based colours on an output device, the conforming reader shall convert from the specified CIE-based colour space to the device’s native colour space (typically **DeviceGray**, **DeviceRGB**, or **DeviceCMYK**), taking into account the known properties of the device.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        As discussed in [8.6.5], "CIE-Based Colour Spaces" CIE-based colour is based on a model of human colour perception. The goal of CIE-based colour rendering is to produce output in the device’s native colour space that accurately reproduces the requested CIE-based colour values as perceived by a human observer. CIE-based colour specification and rendering are a feature of PDF 1.1 (**CalGray**, **CalRGB**, and **Lab**) and PDF 1.3 (ICCBased).
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        The conversion from CIE-based colour to device colour is complex, and the theory on which it is based is beyond the scope of this specification. The algorithm has many parameters, including an optional, full three- dimensional colour lookup table. The colour fidelity of the output depends on having these parameters properly set, usually by a method that includes some form of calibration. The colours that a device can produce are characterized by a *device profile*, which is usually specified by an ICC profile associated with the device (and entirely separate from the profile that is specified in an **ICCBased** colour space).
    
    !!! note "NOTE 3"
    
        PDF has no equivalent of the PostScript colour rendering dictionary. The means by which a device profile is associated with a conforming reader’s output device are implementation-dependent and not specified in a PDF file. Typically, this is done through a colour management system (CMS) that is provided by the operating system. Beginning with PDF 1.4, a PDF file can also specify one or more output intents providing possible profiles that may be used to process the file (see [14.11.5], "Output Intents").
    
    Conversion from a CIE-based colour value to a device colour value requires two main operations:
    
    a) The CIE-based colour value shall be adjusted according to a *CIE-based gamut mapping function*.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 4"
    
        A gamut is a subset of all possible colours in some colour space. A page description has a source gamut consisting of all the colours it uses. An output device has a *device gamut* consisting of all the colours it can reproduce. This step transforms colours from the source gamut to the device gamut in a way that attempts to preserve colour appearance, visual contrast, or some other explicitly specified *rendering intent* (see [8.6.5.8], "Rendering Intents").
    
    b) A corresponding device colour value shall be generated according to a *CIE-based colour mapping function*. For a given CIE-based colour value, this function shall compute a colour value in the device’s native colour space.
    
    The CIE-based gamut and colour mapping functions shall be applied only to colour values presented in a CIE- based colour space. Colour values in device colour spaces directly control the device colour components though this may be altered by the **DefaultGray**, **DefaultRGB**, and **DefaultCMYK** colour space resources (see [8.6.5.6], "Default Colour Spaces").
    
    The source gamut shall be specified by the information contained in the definition of the CIE-based colour space when selected. This specification shall be device-independent. The corresponding properties of the output device shall be given in the device profile associated with the device. The gamut mapping and colour mapping functions are part of the implementation of the conforming reader.
