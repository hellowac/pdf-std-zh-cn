**10.4 Transfer Functions**

=== "中文"

    In the sequence of steps for processing colours, the conforming reader shall apply the transfer function after performing any needed conversions between colour spaces, but *before* applying a halftone function, if necessary. Each colour component shall have its own separate transfer function; there shall not be interaction between components.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        Starting with PDF 1.2, a *transfer function* may be used to adjust the values of colour components to compensate for nonlinear response in an output device and in the human eye. Each component of a device colour space—for example, the red component of the **DeviceRGB** space—is intended to represent the perceived lightness or intensity of that colour component in proportion to the component’s numeric value.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        Many devices do not actually behave this way, however; the purpose of a transfer function is to compensate for the device’s actual behaviour. This operation is sometimes called gamma correction (not to be confused with the *CIE-based gamut mapping function* performed as part of CIE-based colour rendering).
    
    Transfer functions shall always operate in the native colour space of the output device, regardless of the colour space in which colours were originally specified. (For example, for a *CMYK* device, the transfer functions apply to the device’s cyan, magenta, yellow, and black colour components, even if the colours were originally specified in, for example, a **DeviceRGB** or **CalRGB** colour space.) The transfer function shall be called with a numeric operand in the range 0.0 to 1.0 and shall return a number in the same range. The input shall be the value of a colour component in the device’s native colour space, either specified directly or produced by conversion from some other colour space. The output shall be the transformed component value to be transmitted to the device (after halftoning, if necessary).
    
    Both the input and the output of a transfer function shall always be interpreted as if the corresponding colour component were additive (red, green, blue, or gray): the greater the numeric value, the lighter the colour. If the component is subtractive (cyan, magenta, yellow, black, or a spot colour), it shall be converted to additive form by subtracting it from 1.0 before it is passed to the transfer function. The output of the function shall always be in additive form and shall be passed on to the halftone function in that form.
    
    Starting with PDF 1.2, transfer functions shall be defined as PDF function objects (see [7.10], "Functions"). There are two ways to specify transfer functions:
    
    - The *current transfer function* parameter in the graphics state shall consist of either a single transfer function or an array of four separate transfer functions, one each for red, green, blue, and gray or their complements cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. If only a single function is specified, it shall apply to all components. An RGB device shall use the first three, a monochrome device shall use the gray transfer function only, and a *CMYK* device shall use all four. The current transfer function may be specified as the value of the **TR** or **TR2** entry in a graphics state parameter dictionary; see [Table 58].
    - The current halftone parameter in the graphics state may specify transfer functions as optional entries in halftone dictionaries (see [10.5.5], "Halftone Dictionaries"). This is the only way to set transfer functions for nonprimary colour components or for any component in devices whose native colour space uses components other than the ones listed previously. A transfer function specified in a halftone dictionary shall override the corresponding one specified by the current transfer function parameter in the graphics state.
    
    In addition to their intended use for gamma correction, transfer functions may be used to produce a variety of special, device-dependent effects. Because transfer functions produce device-dependent effects, a page description that is intended to be device-independent shall not alter them.
    
    When the current colour space is DeviceGray and the output device’s native colour space is DeviceCMYK, a conforming reader shall use only the gray transfer function. The normal conversion from DeviceGray to DeviceCMYK produces 0.0 for the cyan, magenta, and yellow components. These components shall not be passed through their respective transfer functions but are rendered directly, producing output containing no coloured inks. This special case exists for compatibility with existing conforming readers that use a transfer function to obtain special effects on monochrome devices, and shall apply only to colours specified in the DeviceGray colour space.

        See [11.7.5], "Rendering Parameters and Transparency" and, in particular, [11.7.5.2], "Halftone and Transfer Function" for further discussion of the role of transfer functions in the transparent imaging model.
