**11.2 Overview of Transparency**

=== "中文"

    The original PDF imaging model paints objects (fills, strokes, text, and images), possibly clipped by a path, opaquely onto a page. The colour of the page at any point shall be that of the topmost enclosing object, disregarding any previous objects it may overlap. This effect may be—and often is—realized simply by rendering objects directly to the page in the order in which they are specified, with each object completely overwriting any others that it overlaps.
    
    Under the transparent imaging model, all of the objects on a page may potentially contribute to the result. Objects at a given point may be thought of as forming a transparency stack (or stack for short). The objects shall be arranged from bottom to top in the order in which they are specified. The colour of the page at each point shall be determined by combining the colours of all enclosing objects in the stack according to compositing rules defined by the transparency model.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        The order in which objects are specified determines the stacking order but not necessarily the order in which the objects are actually painted onto the page. In particular, the transparency model does not require a conforming reader to rasterize objects immediately or to commit to a raster representation at any time before rendering the entire stack onto the page. This is important, since rasterization often causes significant loss of information and precision that is best avoided during intermediate stages of the transparency computation.
    
    A given object shall be composited with a backdrop. Ordinarily, the backdrop consists of the stack of all objects that have been specified previously. The result of compositing shall then be treated as the backdrop for the next object. However, within certain kinds of transparency groups (see “[Transparency Groups](./s4.md)”), a different backdrop may be chosen.
    
    During the compositing of an object with its backdrop, the colour at each point shall be computed using a specified *blend mode*, which is a function of both the object’s colour and the backdrop colour. The blend mode shall determine how colours interact; different blend modes may be used to achieve a variety of useful effects. A single blend mode shall be in effect for compositing all of a given object, but different blend modes may be applied to different objects.
    
    Two scalar quantities called shape and opacity mediate compositing of an object with its backdrop. Conceptually, for each object, these quantities shall be defined at every point in the plane, just as if they were additional colour components. (In actual practice, they may be obtained from auxiliary sources rather than being intrinsic to the object.)
    
    Both shape and opacity vary from 0.0 (no contribution) to 1.0 (maximum contribution). At any point where either the shape or the opacity of an object is equal to 0.0, its colour shall be undefined. At points where the shape is equal to 0.0, the opacity shall also be undefined. The shape and opacity shall be subject to compositing rules; therefore, the stack as a whole also has a shape and opacity at each point.
    
    An object’s opacity, in combination with the backdrop’s opacity, shall determine the relative contributions of the backdrop colour, the object’s colour, and the blended colour to the resulting composite colour. The object’s shape shall then determine the degree to which the composite colour replaces the backdrop colour. Shape values of 0.0 and 1.0 identify points that lie outside and inside a conventional sharp-edged object; intermediate values are useful in defining soft-edged objects.
    
    Shape and opacity are conceptually very similar. In fact, they can usually be combined into a single value, called alpha, which controls both the colour compositing computation and the fading between an object and its backdrop. However, there are a few situations in which they shall be treated separately; see [11.4.6], "Knockout Groups."
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        Raster-based implementations may need to maintain a separate shape parameter to do anti-aliasing properly; it is therefore convenient to have shape as an explicit part of the model.
    
    One or more consecutive objects in a stack may be collected together into a transparency group (often referred to hereafter simply as a *group*). The group as a whole may have various properties that modify the compositing behaviour of objects within the group and their interactions with its backdrop. An additional blend mode, shape, and opacity may also be associated with the group as a whole and used when compositing it with its backdrop. Groups may be nested within other groups, forming a tree-structured hierarchy.
    
    !!! note "EXAMPLE"
    
        Figure L.16 in [Annex L] illustrates the effects of transparency grouping. In the upper two figures, three coloured circles are painted as independent objects with no grouping. At the upper left, the three objects are painted opaquely (opacity = 1.0); each object completely replaces its backdrop (including previously painted objects) with its own colour. At the upper right, the same three independent objects are painted with an opacity of 0.5, causing them to composite with each other and with the gray and white backdrop. In the lower two figures, the three objects are combined as a transparency group. At the lower left, the individual objects have an opacity of 1.0 within the group, but the group as a whole is painted in the **Normal** blend mode with an opacity of 0.5. The objects thus completely overwrite each other within the group, but the resulting group then composites transparently with the gray and white backdrop. At the lower right, the objects have an opacity of 0.5 within the group and thus composite with each other. The group as a whole is painted against the backdrop with an opacity of 1.0 but in a different blend mode (**HardLight**), producing a different visual effect.
    
    The colour result of compositing a group may be converted to a single-component luminosity value and treated as a soft mask. Such a mask may then be used as an additional source of shape or opacity values for subsequent compositing operations. When the mask is used as a shape, this technique is known as *soft clipping*; it is a generalization of the current clipping path in the opaque imaging model (see [“Clipping Path Operators](../c8/s5.md#854-剪切路径操作符)”).
    
    The notion of current page is generalized to refer to a transparency group consisting of the entire stack of objects placed on the page, composited with a backdrop that is pure white and fully opaque. Logically, this entire stack shall then be rasterized to determine the actual pixel values to be transmitted to the output device.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 3"
    
        In contexts where a PDF page is treated as a piece of artwork to be placed on some other page it is treated not as a page but as a group, whose backdrop may be defined differently from that of a page.
