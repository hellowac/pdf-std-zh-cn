**Soft Masks**

## 11.5.1 概述

**General**

=== "中文"

    As stated in earlier sub-clauses, the shape and opacity values used in compositing an object may include components called the mask shape ($f_m$) and mask opacity ($q_m$), which may be supplied in a PDF file from a source independent of the object. Such an independent source, called a *soft mask*, defines values that may vary across different points on the page.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        The word *soft* emphasizes that the mask value at a given point is not limited to just 0.0 or 1.0 but can take on intermediate fractional values as well. Such a mask is typically the only means of providing position-dependent opacity values, since elementary objects do not have intrinsic opacity of their own.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        A mask used as a source of shape values is also called a *soft clip*, by analogy with the “hard” clipping path of the opaque imaging model (see Section [8.5.4]). The soft clip is a generalization of the hard clip: a hard clip can be represented as a soft clip having shape values of 1.0 inside and 0.0 outside the clipping path. Everywhere inside a hard clipping path, the source object’s colour replaces the backdrop; everywhere outside, the backdrop shows through unchanged. With a soft clip, by contrast, a gradual transition can be created between an object and its backdrop, as in a vignette.
    
    A mask may be defined by creating a transparency group and painting objects into it, thereby defining colour, shape, and opacity in the usual way. The resulting group may then be used to derive the mask in either of two ways, as described in the following sub-clauses.

**Deriving a Soft Mask from Group Alpha**

=== "中文"

    In the first method of defining a soft mask, the colour, shape, and opacity of a transparency group G shall be first computed by the usual formula
    
    $〈 C, f, α 〉 = \text{Composite} ( C_0 , α_0 , G )$
    
    where $C_0$ and $α_0$ represent an arbitrary backdrop whose value does not contribute to the eventual result. The
    C, f, and α results shall be the group’s colour, shape, and alpha, respectively, with the backdrop factored out.
    
    The mask value at each point shall then be derived from the alpha of the group. The alpha value shall be
    passed through a separately specified transfer function, allowing the masking effect to be customized.
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
        Since the group’s colour is not used in this case, there is no need to compute it.

**Deriving a Soft Mask from Group Luminosity**

=== "中文"

    The second method of deriving a soft mask from a transparency group shall begin by compositing the group with a fully opaque backdrop of a specified colour. The mask value at any given point shall then be defined to be the luminosity of the resulting colour.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        This allows the mask to be derived from the shape and colour of an arbitrary piece of artwork drawn with ordinary painting operators.
    
    The colour C used to create the mask from a group *G* shall be defined by
    
    $\begin{align} 
      \left \langle C_g, f_g, \alpha _g \right \rangle &= \text{Composite}(C_0, 1, G) \\
      C &= (1 - \alpha _g) \times C_0 + \alpha _g \times C_g
    \end{align}$
    
    where $C_0$ is the selected backdrop colour.
    
    G may be any kind of group—isolated or not, knockout or not—producing various effects on the C result in each case. The colour C shall then be converted to luminosity in one of the following ways, depending on the group’s colour space:
    
    - For CIE-based spaces, convert to the CIE 1931 *XYZ* space and use the *Y* component as the luminosity. This produces a colourimetrically correct luminosity.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        In the case of a PDF **CalRGB** space, the formula is
    
        $Y = Y_{A} \times A^{G_R} + Y_B \times B^{G_G} + Y_C \times C^G$
    
        using components of the **Gamma** and **Matrix** entries of the colour space dictionary (see [Table 64](../c8/s6.md#table64) in “[CIE-Based Colour Spaces](../c8/s6.md#865-基于-cie-的色彩空间)”). An analogous computation applies to other CIE-based colour spaces.
    
    - For device colour spaces, convert the colour to **DeviceGray** by implementation-defined means and use the resulting gray value as the luminosity, with no compensation for gamma or other colour calibration.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 3"
    
        This method makes no pretence of colourimetric correctness; it merely provides a numerically simple means to produce continuous-tone mask values. The following are formulas for converting from **DeviceRGB** and **DeviceCMYK**, respectively:
        
        $\begin{align} 
          Y = 0.30 &\times R + 0.59 \times G + 0.11 \times B \\
          Y = 0.30 &\times (1 - C) \times (1 - K) \\
           & + 0.59 \times (1-M)\times (1-K) \\
           & + 0.11 \times (1-Y)\times (1-K)
        \end{align}$
    
    Following this conversion, the result shall be passed through a separately specified transfer function, allowing the masking effect to be customized.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 4"
    
        The backdrop colour most likely to be useful is black, which causes any areas outside the group’s shape to have zero luminosity values in the resulting mask. If the contents of the group are viewed as a positive mask, this produces the results that would be expected with respect to points outside the shape.
