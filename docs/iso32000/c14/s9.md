**14.9 Accessibility Support**

## 14.9.1 概述

**14.9.1 General**

=== "中文"

    PDF includes several facilities in support of accessibility of documents to users with disabilities. In particular, many visually computer users with visual impairments use screen readers to read documents aloud. To enable proper vocalization, either through a screen reader or by some more direct invocation of a text-to-speech engine, PDF supports the following features:
    
    - Specifying the natural language used for text in a PDF document—for example, as English or Spanish, or used to hide or reveal optional content (see [14.9.2], “Natural Language Specification”)
    - Providing textual descriptions for images or other items that do not translate naturally into text ([14.9.3], “Alternate Descriptions”), or replacement text for content that does translate into text but is represented in a nonstandard way (such as with a ligature or illuminated character; see [14.9.4], “Replacement Text”)
    - Specifying the expansion of abbreviations or acronyms (Section [14.9.5], “Expansion of Abbreviations and Acronyms”)
    
    The core of this support lies in the ability to determine the logical order of content in a PDF document, independently of the content’s appearance or layout, through logical structure and Tagged PDF, as described under [14.8.2.3], “Page Content Order.” An accessibility application can extract the content of a document for presentation to users with disabilities by traversing the structure hierarchy and presenting the contents of each node. For this reason, conforming writers ensure that all information in a document is reachable by means of the structure hierarchy, and they should use the facilities described in this sub-clause.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        Text can be extracted from Tagged PDF documents and examined or reused for purposes other than accessibility; see [14.8], “Tagged PDF.”
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        Additional guidelines for accessibility support of content published on the Web can be found in the W3C document *Web Content Accessibility Guidelines* and the documents it points to (see the [Bibliography](../bibliography.md)).

**14.9.2 Natural Language Specification**

### 14.9.2.1 概述

**14.9.2.1 General**

=== "中文"

    Natural language may be specified for text in a document or for optional content.

    The natural language used for text in a document shall be determined in a hierarchical fashion, based on whether an optional **Lang** entry (PDF 1.4) is present in any of several possible locations. At the highest level, the document’s default language (which applies to both text strings and text within content streams) may be specified by a **Lang** entry in the document catalogue (see [7.7.2], “Document Catalog”). Below this, the language may be specified for the following items:
    
    - Structure elements of any type (see [14.7.2], “Structure Hierarchy”), through a **Lang** entry in the structure element dictionary.
    - Marked-content sequences that are not in the structure hierarchy (see [14.6], “Marked Content”), through a **Lang** entry in a property list attached to the marked-content sequence with a Span tag.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        Although **Span** is also a standard structure type, as described under [14.8.4.4], “Inline-Level Structure Elements,” its use here is entirely independent of logical structure.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        The natural language used for optional content allows content to be hidden or revealed, based on the Lang entry (PDF 1.5) in the **Language** dictionary of an optional content usage dictionary.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 3"
    
        The following sub-clauses provide details on the value of the **Lang** entry and the hierarchical manner in which the language for text in a document is determined.
    
    Text strings encoded in Unicode may include an escape sequence or language tag indicating the language of the text and overriding the prevailing **Lang** entry (see [7.9.2.2], “Text String Type”).

**14.9.2.2 Language Identifiers**

=== "中文"

    Certain language-related dictionary entries are text strings that specify language identifiers. Such text strings may appear as **Lang** entries in the following structures or dictionaries:
    
    - Document catalogue, structure element dictionary, or property list
    - Optional content usage dictionary’s Language dictionary, the hierarchical issues described in [14.9.2.3], “Language Specification Hierarchy,” shall not apply to this entry
    
    A language identifier shall either be the empty text string, to indicate that the language is unknown, or a *Language-Tag* as defined in RFC 3066, Tags for the Identification of Languages.
    
    Although language codes are commonly represented using lowercase letters and country codes are commonly represented using uppercase letters, all tags shall be treated as case insensitive.

### 14.9.2.3 语言规范层次结构

**14.9.2.3 Language Specification Hierarchy**

=== "中文"

    The **Lang** entry in the document catalogue shall specify the default natural language for all text in the document. Language specifications may appear within structure elements, and they may appear within marked-content sequences that are not in the structure hierarchy. If present, such language specifications override the default.
    
    Language specifications within the structure hierarchy apply in this order:
    
    - A structure element’s language specification. If a structure element does not have a **Lang** entry, the element shall inherit its language from any parent element that has one.
    - Within a structure element, a language specification for a nested structure element or marked-content sequence
    
    If only part of the page content is contained in the structure hierarchy, and the structured content is nested within nonstructured content for which a different language specification applies, the structure element’s language specification shall take precedence.
    
    A language identifier attached to a marked-content sequence with the Span tag specifies the language for all text in the sequence except for nested marked content that is contained in the structure hierarchy (in which case the structure element’s language applies) and except where overridden by language specifications for other nested marked content.
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
        Examples in this sub-clause illustrate the hierarchical manner in which the language for text in a document is determined.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE 1"
    
        This example shows how a language specified for the document as a whole could be overridden by one specified for a marked-content sequence within a page’s content stream, independent of any logical structure. In this case, the **Lang** entry in the document catalogue (not shown) has the value en-US, meaning U.S. English, and it is overridden by the **Lang** property attached (with the Span tag) to the marked-content sequence Hasta la vista. The **Lang** property identifies the language for this marked content sequence with the value es-MX, meaning Mexican Spanish.
    
        ```text
        2 0 obj                        % Page object
            << /Type /Page
                /Contents 3 0 R        % Content stream
                …
            >>
        endobj
        
        3 0 obj                        % Page's content stream
            << /Length … >>
        stream
            BT
                ( See you later, or as Arnold would say, ) Tj
                /Span << /Lang ( es-MX ) >>        % Start of marked-content sequence
                    BDC
                    ( Hasta la vista . ) Tj
                    EMC                            % End of marked-content sequence
            ET
        endstream
        endobj
        ```
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE 2"
    
        In the following example, the **Lang** entry in the structure element dictionary (specifying English) applies to the marked-content sequence having an **MCID** (marked-content identifier) value of 0 within the indicated page’s content stream. However, nested within that marked-content sequence is another one in which the **Lang** property attached with the Span tag (specifying Spanish) overrides the structure element’s language specification.
    
        This example omits required **StructParents** entries in the objects used as content items (see [14.7.4.4], “Finding Structure Elements from Content Items”).
    
        ```text

    !!! info "EXAMPLE 3"
    
        The page’s content stream consists of a marked-content sequence that specifies Spanish as its language by means of the Span tag with a **Lang** property. Nested within it is content that is part of a structure element (indicated by the **MCID** entry in that property list), and the language specification that applies to the latter content is that of the structure element, English.
    
        This example omits required StructParents entries in the objects used as content items (see [14.7.4.4], “Finding Structure Elements from Content Items”).
    
        ```text

    The **Lang** entry in the document catalogue shall specify the default natural language for all text in the document. Language specifications may appear within structure elements, and they may appear within marked-content sequences that are not in the structure hierarchy. If present, such language specifications override the default.
    
    Language specifications within the structure hierarchy apply in this order:
    
    - A structure element’s language specification. If a structure element does not have a **Lang** entry, the element shall inherit its language from any parent element that has one.
    - Within a structure element, a language specification for a nested structure element or marked-content sequence
    
    If only part of the page content is contained in the structure hierarchy, and the structured content is nested within nonstructured content for which a different language specification applies, the structure element’s language specification shall take precedence.
    
    A language identifier attached to a marked-content sequence with the Span tag specifies the language for all text in the sequence except for nested marked content that is contained in the structure hierarchy (in which case the structure element’s language applies) and except where overridden by language specifications for other nested marked content.
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
        Examples in this sub-clause illustrate the hierarchical manner in which the language for text in a document is determined.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE 1"
    
        This example shows how a language specified for the document as a whole could be overridden by one specified for a marked-content sequence within a page’s content stream, independent of any logical structure. In this case, the **Lang** entry in the document catalogue (not shown) has the value en-US, meaning U.S. English, and it is overridden by the **Lang** property attached (with the Span tag) to the marked-content sequence Hasta la vista. The **Lang** property identifies the language for this marked content sequence with the value es-MX, meaning Mexican Spanish.

However, nested within that marked-content sequence is another one in which the **Lang** property attached with the Span tag (specifying Spanish) overrides the structure element’s language specification.

### 14.9.2.4 多语言文本数组

**14.9.2.4 Multi-language Text Arrays**

=== "中文"

    A multi-language text array (PDF 1.5) allows multiple text strings to be specified, each in association with language identifier. (See the **Alt** entry in [Tables 274](../c13/s2.md#table274) and [277](../c13/s2.md#table277) for examples of its use.)
    
    A multi-language text array shall contain pairs of strings. The first string in each pair shall be a language identifier ([14.9.2.2], “Language Identifiers”). A language identifier shall not appear more than once in the array; any unrecognized language identifier shall be ignored. An empty string specifies default text that may be used when no suitable language identifier is found in the array. The second string is text associated with the language.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE"
    
        [ (en-US) (My vacation) (fr) (mes vacances) ( ) (default text) ]
    
    When a conforming reader searches a multi-language text array to find text for a given language, it shall look for an exact (though case-insensitive) match between the given language’s identifier and the language identifiers in the array. If no exact match is found, prefix matching shall be attempted in increasing array order: a match shall be declared if the given identifier is a leading, case-insensitive, substring of an identifier in the array, and the first post-substring character in the array identifier is a hyphen. For example, given identifier en matches array identifier en-US, but given identifier en-US matches neither en nor en-GB. If no exact or prefix match can be found, the default text (if any) should be used.

**14.9.3 Alternate Descriptions**

=== "中文"

    PDF documents may be enhanced by providing alternate descriptions for images, formulas, or other items that do not translate naturally into text.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        Alternate descriptions are human-readable text that could, for example, be vocalized by a text-to-speech engine for the benefit of users with visual impairments.
    
    An alternate description may be specified for the following items:
    
    - A structure element (see [14.7.2], “Structure Hierarchy”), through an **Alt** entry in the structure element dictionary
    - (PDF 1.5) A marked-content sequence (see [14.6], “Marked Content”), through an **Alt** entry in a property list attached to the marked-content sequence with a Span tag.
    - Any type of annotation (see [12.5], “Annotations”) that does not already have a text representation, through a **Contents** entry in the annotation dictionary
    
    For annotation types that normally display text, the **Contents** entry of the annotation dictionary shall be used as the source for an alternate description. For annotation types that do not display text, a **Contents** entry (PDF 1.4) may be included to specify an alternate description. Sound annotations, which need no alternate description for the purpose of vocalization, may include a **Contents** entry specifying a description that may be displayed for the benefit of users with hearing impairments.
    
    An alternate name may be specified for an interactive form field (see [12.7], “Interactive Forms”) which, if present, shall be used in place of the actual field name when a conforming reader identifies the field in a user- interface. This alternate name, if provided, shall be specified using the **TU** entry of the field dictionary.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        The **TU** entry is useful for vocalization purposes.
    
    Alternate descriptions are text strings, which shall be encoded in either **PDFDocEncoding** or Unicode character encoding.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 3"
    
        As described in [7.9.2.2], “Text String Type,” Unicode defines an escape sequence for indicating the language of the text. This mechanism enables the alternate description to change from the language specified by the prevailing **Lang** entry (as described in the preceding sub-clause). Within alternate descriptions, Unicode escape sequences specifying language shall override the prevailing Lang entry.
    
    When applied to structure elements, the alternate description text shall be considered to be a complete (or whole) word or phrase substitution for the current element. If each of two (or more) elements in a sequence have an **Alt** entry in their dictionaries, they shall be treated as if a word break is present between them. The same applies to consecutive marked-content sequences.
    
    The **Alt** entry in property lists may be combined with other entries.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE"
    
        This example shows the **Alt** entry combined with a **Lang** entry.
    
        ```text
        /Span << /Lang (en-us) /Alt (six-point star) >> BDC (A) Tj EMC
        ```

**14.9.4 Replacement Text**

=== "中文"

    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        Just as alternate descriptions can be provided for images and other items that do not translate naturally into text (as described in the preceding sub-clause), replacement text can be specified for content that does translate into text but that is represented in a nonstandard way. These nonstandard representations might include, for example, glyphs for ligatures or custom characters, or inline graphics corresponding to letters in an illuminated manuscript or to dropped capitals.
    
    Replacement text may be specified for the following items:
    
    - A structure element (see [14.7.2], “Structure Hierarchy”), by means of the optional **ActualText** entry (PDF 1.4) of the structure element dictionary.
    - (PDF 1.5) A marked-content sequence (see 14.6, “Marked Content”), through an **ActualText** entry in a property list attached to the marked-content sequence with a Span tag.
    
    The **ActualText** value shall be used as a replacement, not a description, for the content, providing text that is equivalent to what a person would see when viewing the content. The value of **ActualText** shall be considered to be a character substitution for the structure element or marked-content sequence. If each of two (or more) consecutive structure or marked-content sequences has an **ActualText** entry, they shall be treated as if no word break is present between them.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        The treatment of **ActualText** as a character replacement is different from the treatment of **Alt**, which is treated as a whole word or phrase substitution.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE"
    
        This example shows the use of replacement text to indicate the correct character content in a case where hyphenation changes the spelling of a word (in German, up until recent spelling reforms, the word “Drucker” when hyphenated was rendered as “Druk-” and “ker”).
    
        ```text
        (Dru) Tj

                (k-) Tj
            EMC
        (ker) '
        ```
    
    Like alternate descriptions (and other text strings), replacement text, if encoded in Unicode, may include an escape sequence for indicating the language of the text. Such a sequence shall override the prevailing **Lang** entry (see [7.9.2.2], “Text String Type”).

## 14.9.5 缩写和首字母缩写的扩展

**14.9.5 Expansion of Abbreviations and Acronyms**

=== "中文"

    The expansion of an abbreviation or acronym may be specified for the following items:
    
    - Marked-content sequences, through an **E** property (PDF 1.4) in a property list attached to the sequence with a Span tag.
    - Structure elements, through an **E** entry (PDF 1.5) in the structure element dictionary.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        Abbreviations and acronyms can pose a problem for text-to-speech engines. Sometimes the full pronunciation for an abbreviation can be divined without aid. For example, a dictionary search will probably reveal that “Blvd.” is pronounced “boulevard” and that “Ave.” is pronounced “avenue.” However, some abbreviations are difficult to resolve, as in the sentence “Dr. Healwell works at 123 Industrial Dr.”.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE"
    
        ```text

                EMC
        ET

    The **E** value (a text string) shall be considered to be a word or phrase substitution for the tagged text and therefore shall be treated as if a word break separates it from any surrounding text.The expansion text, if encoded in Unicode, may include an escape sequence for indicating the language of the text (see [7.9.2.2], “Text String Type”). Such a sequence shall override the prevailing Lang entry.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        Some abbreviations or acronyms are conventionally not expanded into words. For the text “XYZ,” for example, either no expansion should be supplied (leaving its pronunciation up to the text-to-speech engine) or, to be safe, the expansion “X Y Z” should be specified.
