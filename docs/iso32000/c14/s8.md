**14.8.1 General**

=== "中文"

    Tagged PDF (PDF 1.4) is a stylized use of PDF that builds on the logical structure framework described in [14.7], “Logical Structure.” It defines a set of standard structure types and attributes that allow page content (text, graphics, and images) to be extracted and reused for other purposes. A tagged PDF document is one that conforms to the rules described in this sub-clause. A conforming writer is not required to produce tagged PDF documents; however, if it does, it shall conform to these rules.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        It is intended for use by tools that perform the following types of operations:
    
        - Simple extraction of text and graphics for pasting into other applications
        - Automatic reflow of text and associated graphics to fit a page of a different size than was assumed for the original layout
        - Processing text for such purposes as searching, indexing, and spell-checking
        - Conversion to other common file formats (such as HTML, XML, and RTF) with document structure and basic styling information preserved
        - Making content accessible to users with visual impairments (see [14.9], “Accessibility Support”)
    
    A tagged PDF document shall conform to the following rules:
    
    - Page content ([14.8.2], “Tagged PDF and Page Content”). Tagged PDF defines a set of rules for representing text in the page content so that characters, words, and text order can be determined reliably. All text shall be represented in a form that can be converted to Unicode. Word breaks shall be represented explicitly. Actual content shall be distinguished from artifacts of layout and pagination. Content shall be given in an order related to its appearance on the page, as determined by the conforming writer.
    - A basic layout model ([14.8.3], “Basic Layout Model”). A set of rules for describing the arrangement of structure elements on the page.
    - Structure types ([14.8.4], “Standard Structure Types”). A set of standard structure types define the meaning of structure elements, such as paragraphs, headings, articles, and tables.
    - Structure attributes ([14.8.5], “Standard Structure Attributes”). Standard structure attributes preserve styling information used by the conforming writer in laying out content on the page.
    
    A Tagged PDF document shall also contain a mark information dictionary (see Table 321) with a value of true for the **Marked** entry.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        The types and attributes defined for Tagged PDF are intended to provide a set of standard fallback roles and minimum guaranteed attributes to enable conforming readers to perform operations such as those mentioned previously. Conforming writers are free to define additional structure types as long as they also provide a role mapping to the nearest equivalent standard types, as described in [14.7.3], “Structure Types.” Likewise, conforming writers can define additional structure attributes using any of the available extension mechanisms.

**14.8.2 Tagged PDF and Page Content**

### 14.8.2.1 概述

**14.8.2.1 General**

=== "中文"

    Like all PDF documents, a Tagged PDF document consists of a sequence of self-contained pages, each of which shall be described by one or more page content streams (including any subsidiary streams such as form XObjects and annotation appearances). Tagged PDF defines some further rules for organizing and marking content streams so that additional information can be derived from them:
    
    - Distinguishing between the author’s original content and artifacts of the layout process (see [14.8.2.2], “Real Content and Artifacts”).
    - Specifying a content order to guide the layout process if the conforming reader reflows the page content (see [14.8.2.3], “Page Content Order”).
    - Representing text in a form from which a Unicode representation and information about font characteristics can be unambiguously derived (see [14.8.2.4], “Extraction of Character Properties”).
    - Representing word breaks unambiguously (see [14.8.2.5], “Identifying Word Breaks”).
    - Marking text with information for making it accessible to users with visual impairments (see [14.9], “Accessibility Support”).

**14.8.2.2 Real Content and Artifacts**

#### 14.8.2.2.1 概述

**14.8.2.2.1 General**

=== "中文"

    The graphics objects in a document can be divided into two classes:
    
    - The real content of a document comprises objects representing material originally introduced by the document’s author.
    - Artifacts are graphics objects that are not part of the author’s original content but rather are generated by the conforming writer in the course of pagination, layout, or other strictly mechanical processes.
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
        Artifacts may also be used to describe areas of the document where the author uses a graphical background, with the goal of enhancing the visual experience. In such a case, the background is not required for understanding the content.
    
    The document’s logical structure encompasses all graphics objects making up the real content and describes how those objects relate to one another. It does not include graphics objects that are mere artifacts of the layout and production process.
    
    A document’s real content includes not only the page content stream and subsidiary form XObjects but also associated annotations that meet all of the following conditions:
    
    - The annotation has an appearance stream (see [12.5.5], “Appearance Streams”) containing a normal (N) appearance.
    - The annotation’s Hidden flag (see [12.5.3], “Annotation Flags”) is not set.
    - The annotation is included in the document’s logical structure (see [14.7], “Logical Structure”).

**14.8.2.2.2 Specification of Artifacts**

=== "中文"

    An artifact shall be explicitly distinguished from real content by enclosing it in a marked-content sequence with the tag Artifact:
    
        /Artifact                /Artifact propertyList
            BMC                       BDC

    The first form shall be used to identify a generic artifact; the second shall be used for those that have an associated property list. [Table 330](#table330) shows the properties that can be included in such a property list.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        To aid in text reflow, artifacts should be defined with property lists whenever possible. Artifacts lacking a specified bounding box are likely to be discarded during reflow.

Page edges shall be defined by the page’s crop box (see [14.11.2], “Page Boundaries”). The ordering of names within the array is immaterial. Including both Left and Right or both Top and Bottom indicates a full-width or full-height artifact, respectively. <br/>
                Use of this entry for background artifacts shall be limited to full-page artifacts. Background artifacts that are not full-page take their dimensions from their parent structural element.

    The following types of artifacts can be specified by the **Type** entry:
    
    - Pagination artifacts. Ancillary page features such as running heads and folios (page numbers).
    - Layout artifacts. Purely cosmetic typographical or design elements such as footnote rules or background screens.
    - Page artifacts. Production aids extraneous to the document itself, such as cut marks and colour bars.
    - Background artifacts. Images, patterns or coloured blocks that either run the entire length and/or width of the page or the entire dimensions of a structural element. Background artifacts typically serve as a background for content shown either on top of or placed adjacent to that background.
    
    A background artifact can further be classified as visual content that serves to enhance the user experience,
    that lies under the actual content, and that is not required except to retain visual fidelity.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        Examples of this include a coloured background, pattern, blend, or image that resides under main body text. In the case of white text on a black background, the black background is absolutely necessary to be able to read the white text; however, the background itself is merely there to enhance the visual experience. However, a draft or other identifying watermark is classified as a pagination artifact because it does not serve to enhance the experience; rather, it serves as a running artifact typically used on every page in the document. As a further example, a Figure differs from a background artifact in that removal of the graphics objects from a Figure would detract from the overall contextual understanding of the Figure as an entity.
    
        - Tagged conforming readers may have their own ideas about what page content to consider relevant. A text-to-speech engine, for instance, probably should not speak running heads or page numbers when the page is turned. In general, conforming readers can do any of the following:
        - Disregard elements of page content (for example, specific types of artifacts) that are not of interest
        - Treat some page elements as *terminals* that are not to be examined further (for example, to treat an illustration as a unit for reflow purposes)
        - Replace an element with alternate text (see [14.9.3], “Alternate Descriptions”)
    
    !!! note "NOTE 3"
    
        Depending on their goals, different conforming readers can make different decisions in this regard. The purpose of Tagged PDF is not to prescribe what the conforming reader should do, but to provide sufficient declarative and descriptive information to allow it to make appropriate choices about how to process the content.
    
    To support conforming readers in providing accessibility to users with disabilities, Tagged PDF documents should use the natural language specification (**Lang**), alternate description (**Alt**), replacement text (**ActualText**), and abbreviation expansion text (**E**) facilities described in [14.9], “Accessibility Support.”

**14.8.2.2.3 Incidental Artifacts**

=== "中文"

    In addition to objects that are explicitly marked as artifacts and excluded from the document’s logical structure, the running text of a page may contain other elements and relationships that are not logically part of the document’s real content, but merely incidental results of the process of laying out that content into a document. They may include the following elements:
    
    - Hyphenation. Among the artifacts introduced by text layout is the hyphen marking the incidental division of a word at the end of a line. In Tagged PDF, such an incidental word division shall be represented by a soft hyphen character, which the Unicode mapping algorithm (see “[Unicode Mapping in Tagged PDF](#148242-标签化-pdf-中的-unicode-映射)” in [14.8.2.4], “Extraction of Character Properties”) translates to the Unicode value U+00AD. (This character is distinct from an ordinary *hard hyphen*, whose Unicode value is U+002D.) The producer of a Tagged PDF document shall distinguish explicitly between soft and hard hyphens so that the consumer does not have to guess which type a given character represents.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        In some languages, the situation is more complicated: there may be multiple hyphen characters, and hyphenation may change the spelling of words. See the Example in [14.9.4], “Replacement Text.”
    
    - Text discontinuities. The running text of a page, as expressed in page content order (see [14.8.2.3], “Page Content Order”), may contain places where the normal progression of text suffers a discontinuity. Conforming readers may recognize such discontinuities by examining the document’s logical structure.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        For example, the page may contain the beginnings of two separate articles (see [12.4.3], “Articles”), each of which is continued onto a later page of the document. The last words of the first article appearing on the page should not be run together with the first words of the second article.
    
    - *Hidden page elements*. For a variety of reasons, elements of a document’s logical content may be invisible on the page: they may be clipped, their colour may match the background, or they may be obscured by other, overlapping objects. For the purposes of Tagged PDF, page content shall be considered to include all text and illustrations in their entirety, regardless of whether they are visible when the document is displayed or printed.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 3"
    
        For example, formerly invisible elements may become visible when a page is reflowed, or a text-to-speech engine may choose to speak text that is not visible to a sighted reader.

        In some languages, the situation is more complicated: there may be multiple hyphen characters, and hyphenation may change the spelling of words. See the Example in [14.9.4], “Replacement Text.”
    
    - Text discontinuities. The running text of a page, as expressed in page content order (see [14.8.2.3], “Page Content Order”), may contain places where the normal progression of text suffers a discontinuity. Conforming readers may recognize such discontinuities by examining the document’s logical structure.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        For example, the page may contain the beginnings of two separate articles (see [12.4.3], “Articles”), each of which is continued onto a later page of the document. The last words of the first article appearing on the page should not be run together with the first words of the second article.
    
    - *Hidden page elements*. For a variety of reasons, elements of a document’s logical content may be invisible on the page: they may be clipped, their colour may match the background, or they may be obscured by other, overlapping objects. For the purposes of Tagged PDF, page content shall be considered to include all text and illustrations in their entirety, regardless of whether they are visible when the document is displayed or printed.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 3"
    
        For example, formerly invisible elements may become visible when a page is reflowed, or a text-to-speech engine may choose to speak text that is not visible to a sighted reader.

**14.8.2.3.1 General**

=== "中文"

    When dealing with material on a page-by-page basis, some Tagged PDF conforming readers may choose to process elements in *page content order*, determined by the sequencing of graphics objects within a page’s content stream and of characters within a text object, rather than in the *logical structure order* defined by a depth-first traversal of the page’s logical structure hierarchy. The two orderings are logically distinct and may or may not coincide. In particular, any artifacts the page may contain shall be included in the page content order but not in the logical structure order, since they are not considered part of the document’s logical structure. The conforming writer is responsible for establishing both an appropriate page content order for each page and an appropriate logical structure hierarchy for the entire document.
    
    Because the primary requirement for page content order is to enable reflow to maintain elements in proper reading sequence, it should normally (for Western writing systems) proceed from top to bottom (and, in a multiple-column layout, from column to column), with artifacts in their correct relative places. In general, all parts of an article that appear on a given page should be kept together, even if the article flows to scattered locations on the page. Illustrations or footnotes may be interspersed with the text of the associated article or may appear at the end of its content (or, in the case of footnotes, at the end of the entire page’s logical content).
    
    In some situations, conforming writer may be unable to determine correct page content order for part of a document’s contents. In such cases, tag suspects (PDF 1.6) can be used. The conforming writer shall identify suspect content by using marked content (see [14.6], “Marked Content”) with a tag of TagSuspect, as shown in next Example. The marked content shall have a properties dictionary with an entry whose name is **TagSuspect** and whose value is **Ordering**, which indicates that the ordering of the enclosed marked content does not meet Tagged PDF specifications.
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
        This can occur, for example, if content was extracted from another application, or if there are ambiguities or missing information in text output.

    Documents containing tag suspects shall contain a Suspects entry with a value of true in the mark information dictionary (see [Table 321](./s7.md#table321)).

**14.8.2.3.2 Sequencing of Annotations**

=== "中文"

    Annotations associated with a page are not interleaved within the page’s content stream but shall be placed in the **Annots** array in its page object (see [7.7.3.3], “Page Objects”). Consequently, the correct position of an annotation in the page content order is not readily apparent but shall be determined from the document’s logical structure.
    
    Both page content (marked-content sequences) and annotations may be treated as content items that are referenced from structure elements (see [14.7.4], “Structure Content”). Structure elements of type Annot (PDF 1.5), Link, or Form (see [14.8.4.4], “Inline-Level Structure Elements,” and [14.8.4.5], “Illustration Elements”) explicitly specify the association between a marked-content sequence and a corresponding annotation. In other cases, if the structure element corresponding to an annotation immediately precedes or follows (in the logical structure order) a structure element corresponding to a marked-content sequence, the annotation is considered to precede or follow the marked-content sequence, respectively, in the page content order.
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
        If necessary, a conforming writer may introduce an empty marked-content sequence solely to serve as a structure element for the purpose of positioning adjacent annotations in the page content order.

**14.8.2.3.3 Reverse-Order Show Strings**

=== "中文"

    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        In writing systems that are read from right to left (such as Arabic or Hebrew), one might expect that the glyphs in a font would have their origins at the lower right and their widths (rightward horizontal displacements) specified as negative. For various technical and historical reasons, however, many such fonts follow the same conventions as those designed for Western writing systems, with glyph origins at the lower left and positive widths, as shown in Figure 39. Consequently, showing text in such right-to-left writing systems requires either positioning each glyph individually (which is tedious and costly) or representing text with show strings (see [9.2], “Organization and Use of Fonts”) whose character codes are given in reverse order. When the latter method is used, the character codes’ correct page content order is the reverse of their order within the show string.
    
    The marked-content tag ReversedChars informs the conforming reader that show strings within a marked-content sequence contain characters in the reverse of page content order. If the sequence encompasses multiple show strings, only the individual characters within each string shall be reversed; the strings themselves shall be in natural reading order.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE"

    The show strings may have a SPACE (U+0020) character at the beginning or end to indicate a word break (see [14.8.2.5], “Identifying Word Breaks”) but shall not contain interior SPACEs.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        This limitation is not serious, since a SPACE provides an opportunity to realign the typography without visible effect, and it serves the valuable purpose of limiting the scope of reversals for word-processing conforming readers.

    Tagged PDF enables character codes to be unambiguously converted to Unicode values representing the information content of the text. There are several methods for doing this; a Tagged PDF document shall conform to at least one of them (see “Unicode Mapping in Tagged PDF” in [14.8.2.4], “Extraction of Character Properties”). In addition, Tagged PDF enables some characteristics of the associated fonts to be deduced (see “Font Characteristics” in [14.8.2.4], “Extraction of Character Properties”).

**14.8.2.4.2 Unicode Mapping in Tagged PDF**

=== "中文"

    Tagged PDF requires that every character code in a document can be mapped to a corresponding Unicode value.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        Unicode defines scalar values for most of the characters used in the world’s languages and writing systems, as well as providing a private use area for application-specific characters. Information about Unicode can be found in the Unicode Standard, by the Unicode Consortium (see the Bibliography).
    
    The methods for mapping a character code to a Unicode value are described in [9.10.2], “Mapping Character Codes to Unicode Values.” A conforming writer shall ensure that the PDF file contains enough information to map all character codes to Unicode by one of the methods described there.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        An **Alt**, **ActualText**, or **E** entry specified in a structure element dictionary or a marked-content property list (see [14.9.3], “Alternate Descriptions,” [14.9.4], “Replacement Text,” and [14.9.5], “Expansion of Abbreviations and Acronyms”) may affect the character stream that some conforming readers actually use. For example, some conforming readers may choose to use the **Alt** or **ActualText** value and ignore all text and other content associated with the structure element and its descendants.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 3"
    
        Some uses of Tagged PDF require characters that may not be available in all fonts, such as the soft hyphen (see [14.8.2.2.3], “Incidental Artifacts”). Such characters may be represented either by adding them to the font’s encoding or CMap and using **ToUnicode** to map them to appropriate Unicode values, or by using an **ActualText** entry in the associated structure element to provide substitute characters.

**14.8.2.5 Identifying Word Breaks**

=== "中文"

    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        A document’s text stream defines not only the characters in a page’s text but also the words. Unlike a character, the notion of a word is not precisely defined but depends on the purpose for which the text is being processed. A reflow tool needs to determine where it can break the running text into lines; a text-to-speech engine needs to identify the words to be vocalized; spelling checkers and other applications all have their own ideas of what constitutes a word. It is not important for a Tagged PDF document to identify the words within the text stream according to a single, unambiguous definition that satisfies all of these clients. What is important is that there be enough information available for each client to make that determination for itself.
    
    A conforming reader of a Tagged PDF document may find words by sequentially examining the Unicode character stream, perhaps augmented by replacement text specified with **ActualText** (see [14.9.4], “Replacement Text”). For this purpose the spacing characters that would be present to separate words in a pure text representation shall be present in the Tagged PDF representation of the text.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        The conforming reader does not need to guess about word breaks based on information such as glyph positioning on the page, font changes, or glyph sizes.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 3"
    
        The identification of what constitutes a word is unrelated to how the text happens to be grouped into show strings. The division into show strings has no semantic significance. In particular, a SPACE (U+0020) or other word-breaking character is still needed even if a word break happens to fall at the end of a show string.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 4"
    
        Some conforming readers may identify words by simply separating them at every SPACE character. Others may be slightly more sophisticated and treat punctuation marks such as hyphens or em dashes as word separators as well. Still others may identify possible line-break opportunities by using an algorithm similar to the one in Unicode Standard Annex #29, Text Boundaries, available from the Unicode Consortium (see the [Bibliography](../bibliography.md)).

## 14.8.3 基础布局模型

**14.8.3 Basic Layout Model**

=== "中文"

    The basic layout model begins with the notion of a reference area. This is a rectangular region used as a frame or guide in which to place the document’s content. Some of the standard structure attributes, such as **StartIndent** and **EndIndent** (see [14.8.5.4.3], “Layout Attributes for BLSEs”), shall be measured from the boundaries of the reference area. Reference areas are not specified explicitly but are inferred from context. Those of interest are generally the column area or areas in a general text layout, the outer bounding box of a table and those of its component cells, and the bounding box of an illustration or other floating element.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        Tagged PDF’s standard structure types and attributes shall be interpreted in the context of a basic layout model that describes the arrangement of structure elements on the page. This model is designed to capture the general intent of the document’s underlying structure and does not necessarily correspond to the one actually used for page layout by the application creating the document. (The PDF content stream specifies the exact appearance.) The goal is to provide sufficient information for conforming readers to make their own layout decisions while preserving the authoring application’s intent as closely as their own layout models allow.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        The Tagged PDF layout model resembles the ones used in markup languages such as HTML, CSS, XSL, and RTF, but does not correspond exactly to any of them. The model is deliberately defined loosely to allow reasonable latitude in the interpretation of structure elements and attributes when converting to other document formats. Some degree of variation in the resulting layout from one format to another is to be expected.
    
    The standard structure types are divided into four main categories according to the roles they play in page layout:
    
    - *Grouping elements* (see [14.8.4.2], “Grouping Elements”) group other elements into sequences or hierarchies but hold no content directly and have no direct effect on layout.
    - *Block-level structure elements* (BLSEs) (see [14.8.4.3], “Block-Level Structure Elements”) describe the overall layout of content on the page, proceeding in the *block-progression direction*.
    - *Inline-level structure elements* (ILSEs) (see [14.8.4.4], “Inline-Level Structure Elements”) describe the layou of content within a BLSE, proceeding in the *inline-progression direction*.
    - Illustration elements (see [14.8.4.5], “Illustration Elements”) are compact sequences of content, in page content order, that are considered to be unitary objects with respect to page layout. An illustration can be treated as either a BLSE or an ILSE.
    
    The meaning of the terms *block-progression direction* and *inline-progression direction* depends on the writing system in use, as specified by the standard attribute **WritingMode** (see [14.8.5.4.2], “General Layout Attributes”). In Western writing systems, the block direction is from top to bottom and the inline direction is from left to right. Other writing systems use different directions for laying out content.
    
    Because the progression directions can vary depending on the writing system, edges of areas and directions on the page are identified by terms that are neutral with respect to the progression order rather than by familiar terms such as *up, down, left, and right*. Block layout proceeds from *before* to *after*, inline from start to end. Thus, for example, in Western writing systems, the before and after edges of a reference area are at the top and bottom, respectively, and the start and end edges are at the left and right. Another term, *shift direction* (the direction of shift for a superscript), refers to the direction opposite that for block progression—that is, from after to before (in Western writing systems, from bottom to top).
    
    BLSEs shall be stacked within a reference area in block-progression order. In general, the first BLSE shall be placed against the before edge of the reference area. Subsequent BLSEs shall be stacked against preceding ones, progressing toward the after edge, until no more BLSEs fit in the reference area. If the overflowing BLSE allows itself to be split—such as a paragraph that can be split between lines of text—a portion of it may be included in the current reference area and the remainder carried over to a subsequent reference area (either elsewhere on the same page or on another page of the document). Once the amount of content that fits in a reference area is determined, the placements of the individual BLSEs may be adjusted to bias the placement toward the before edge, the middle, or the after edge of the reference area, or the spacing within or between BLSEs may be adjusted to fill the full extent of the reference area.
    
    BLSEs may be nested, with child BLSEs stacked within a parent BLSE in the same manner as BLSEs within a reference area. Except in a few instances noted (the BlockAlign and InlineAlign elements), such nesting of BLSEs does not result in the nesting of reference areas; a single reference area prevails for all levels of nested BLSEs.
    
    Within a BLSE, child ILSEs shall be packed into lines. Direct content items—those that are immediate children of a BLSE rather than contained within a child ILSE—shall be implicitly treated as ILSEs for packing purposes. Each line shall be treated as a synthesized BLSE and shall be stacked within the parent BLSE. Lines may be intermingled with other BLSEs within the parent area. This line-building process is analogous to the stacking of BLSEs within a reference area, except that it proceeds in the inline-progression rather than the block- progression direction: a line shall be packed with ILSEs beginning at the start edge of the containing BLSE and continuing until the end edge shall be reached and the line is full. The overflowing ILSE may allow itself to be broken at linguistically determined or explicitly marked break points (such as hyphenation points within a word), and the remaining fragment shall be carried over to the next line.
    
    Certain values of an element’s **Placement** attribute remove the element from the normal stacking or packing process and allow it instead to float to a specified edge of the enclosing reference area or parent BLSE; see “General Layout Attributes” in [14.8.5.4], “Layout Attributes,” for further discussion.
    
    Two enclosing rectangles shall be associated with each BLSE and ILSE (including direct content items that are treated implicitly as ILSEs):
    
    - The content rectangle shall be derived from the shape of the enclosed content and defines the bounds used for the layout of any included child elements.
    - The allocation rectangle includes any additional borders or spacing surrounding the element, affecting how it shall be positioned with respect to adjacent elements and the enclosing content rectangle or reference area.
    
    The definitions of these rectangles shall be determined by layout attributes associated with the structure element; see [14.8.5.4.5], “Content and Allocation Rectangles” for further discussion.

**14.8.4 Standard Structure Types**

### 14.8.4.1 概述

**14.8.4.1 General**

=== "中文"

    Tagged PDF’s *standard structure types* characterize the role of a content element within the document and, in conjunction with the standard structure attributes (described in [14.8.5], “Standard Structure Attributes”), how that content is laid out on the page. As discussed in [14.7.3], “Structure Types,” the structure type of a logical structure element shall be specified by the **S** entry in its structure element dictionary. To be considered a standard structure type, this value shall be either:
    
    - One of the standard structure type names described in [14.8.4.2], “Grouping Elements.”
    - An arbitrary name that shall be mapped to one of the standard names by the document’s role map (see
    [14.7.3], “Structure Types”), possibly through multiple levels of mapping.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        Beginning with PDF 1.5, an element name is always mapped to its corresponding name in the role map, if there is one, even if the original name is one of the standard types. This is done to allow the element, for example, to represent a tag with the same name as a standard role, even though its use differs from the standard role.
    
    Ordinarily, structure elements having standard structure types shall be processed the same way whether the type is expressed directly or is determined indirectly from the role map. However, some conforming readers may ascribe additional semantics to nonstandard structure types, even though the role map associates them with standard ones.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        For instance, the actual values of the S entries may be used when exporting to a tagged representation such as XML, and the corresponding role-mapped values shall be used when converting to presentation formats such as HTML or RTF, or for purposes such as reflow or accessibility to users with disabilities.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 3"
    
        Most of the standard element types are designed primarily for laying out text; the terminology reflects this usage. However, a layout may in fact include any type of content, such as path or image objects.
    
    The content items associated with a structure element shall be laid out on the page as if they were blocks of text (for a BLSE) or characters within a line of text (for an ILSE).

**14.8.4.2 Grouping Elements**

=== "中文"

    *Grouping elements* shall be used solely to group other structure elements; they are not directly associated with content items. [Table 333](#table333) describes the standard structure types for elements in this category. [H.8](../a8.md#h8-描述分层列表的结构化元素), “Structured Elements That Describe Hierarchical Lists” provides an example of nested table of content items.
    
    In a tagged PDF document, the structure tree shall contain a single top-level element; that is, the structure tree root (identified by the **StructTreeRoot** entry in the document catalogue) shall have only one child in its **K** (kids) array. If the PDF file contains a complete document, the structure type Document should be used for this top- level element in the logical structure hierarchy. If the file contains a well-formed document fragment, one of the structure types Part, Art, Sect, or Div may be used instead.

    *Grouping elements* shall be used solely to group other structure elements; they are not directly associated with content items. [Table 333](#table333) describes the standard structure types for elements in this category. [H.8](../a8.md#h8-描述分层列表的结构化元素), “Structured Elements That Describe Hierarchical Lists” provides an example of nested table of content items.
    
    In a tagged PDF document, the structure tree shall contain a single top-level element; that is, the structure tree root (identified by the **StructTreeRoot** entry in the document catalogue) shall have only one child in its **K** (kids) array. If the PDF file contains a complete document, the structure type Document should be used for this top- level element in the logical structure hierarchy. If the file contains a well-formed document fragment, one of the structure types Part, Art, Sect, or Div may be used instead.

#### 14.8.4.3.5 区块级结构的使用指南

**14.8.4.3.5 Usage Guidelines for Block-Level Structure**

=== "中文"

    Because different conforming readers use PDF’s logical structure facilities in different ways, Tagged PDF does not enforce any strict rules regarding the order and nesting of elements using the standard structure types. Furthermore, each export format has its own conventions for logical structure. However, adhering to certain general guidelines helps to achieve the most consistent and predictable interpretation among different Tagged PDF consumers.
    
    As described under [14.8.4.2], “Grouping Elements,” a Tagged PDF document may have one or more levels of grouping elements, such as Document, Part, Art (Article), Sect (Section), and Div (Division). The descendants of these should be BLSEs, such as H (Heading), P (Paragraph), and L (List), that hold the actual content. Their descendants, in turn, should be either content items or ILSEs that further describe the content.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        As noted earlier, elements with structure types that would ordinarily be treated as ILSEs may have a **Placement** attribute (see “General Layout Attributes” in [14.8.5.4], “Layout Attributes”) that causes them to be treated as BLSEs instead. Such elements may be included as BLSEs in the same manner as headings and paragraphs.
    
    The block-level structure may follow one of two principal paradigms:
    
    - *Strongly structured*. The grouping elements nest to as many levels as necessary to reflect the organization of the material into articles, sections, subsections, and so on. At each level, the children of the grouping element should consist of a heading (H), one or more paragraphs (P) for content at that level, and perhaps one or more additional grouping elements for nested subsections.
    - *Weakly structured*. The document is relatively flat, having perhaps only one or two levels of grouping elements, with all the headings, paragraphs, and other BLSEs as their immediate children. In this case, the organization of the material is not reflected in the logical structure; however, it may be expressed by the use of headings with specific levels (H1–H6).
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        The strongly structured paradigm is used by some rich document models based on XML. The weakly structured paradigm is typical of documents represented in HTML.
    
    Lists and tables should be organized using the specific structure types described under “List Elements” in [14.8.4.3], “Block-Level Structure Elements,” and “Table Elements” in [14.8.4.3], “Block-Level Structure Elements”. Likewise, tables of contents and indexes should be structured as described for the TOC and Index structure types under “Grouping Elements” in [14.8.4.2], “Grouping Elements.”

**14.8.4.4 Inline-Level Structure Elements**

#### 14.8.4.4.1 概述

**14.8.4.4.1 General**

=== "中文"

    An *inline-level structure element* (ILSE) contains a portion of text or other content having specific styling characteristics or playing a specific role in the document. Within a paragraph or other block defined by a containing BLSE, consecutive ILSEs—possibly intermixed with other content items that are direct children of the parent BLSE—are laid out consecutively in the inline-progression direction (left to right in Western writing systems). The resulting content may be broken into multiple *lines*, which in turn shall be stacked in the block- progression direction. An ILSE may in turn contain a BLSE, which shall be treated as a unitary item of layout in the inline direction. [Table 338](#table338) lists the standard structure types for ILSEs.
            
    <table id="table338" markdown="span">

        </thead>

            <tr>
                <td>Span</td>
                <td>
                    (Span) A generic inline portion of text having no particular inherent characteristics. It can be used, for example, to delimit a range of text with a given set of styling attributes.<br />
                    <br />
                    NOTE 1 &emsp; Not all inline style changes need to be identified as a span. Text colour and font changes (including modifiers such as bold, italic, and small caps) need not be so marked, since these can be derived from the PDF
                    content (see “Font Characteristics” in [14.8.2.4], “Extraction of Character Properties”). However, it is necessary to use a span to apply explicit layout attributes such as **LineHeight**, **BaselineShift**, or
                    **TextDecorationType** (see “Layout Attributes for ILSEs” in [14.8.5.4], “Layout Attributes”).<br />
                    NOTE 2 &emsp; Marked-content sequences having the tag Span are also used to carry certain accessibility properties (Alt, ActualText, Lang, and E; see [14.9], “Accessibility Support”). Such sequences lack an MCID property and are not
                    associated with any structure element. This use of the Span marked-content tag is distinct from its use as a structure type.

                    The quoted text should be contained inline within a single paragraph. This differs from the block-level element BlockQuote (see [14.8.4.2], “Grouping Elements”), which consists of one or more complete paragraphs (or other elements
                    presented as if they were complete paragraphs).

                    Elements”) as a child. The note may be included as a child of the structure element in the body text that refers to it, or it may be included elsewhere (such as in an endnotes section) and accessed by means of a reference (structure
                    type Reference).<br />
                    Tagged PDF does not prescribe the placement of footnotes in the page content order. They may be either inline or at the end of the page, at the discretion of the conforming writer.

                    (Span) A generic inline portion of text having no particular inherent characteristics. It can be used, for example, to delimit a range of text with a given set of styling attributes.<br />
                    <br />
                    NOTE 1 &emsp; Not all inline style changes need to be identified as a span. Text colour and font changes (including modifiers such as bold, italic, and small caps) need not be so marked, since these can be derived from the PDF
                    content (see “Font Characteristics” in [14.8.2.4], “Extraction of Character Properties”). However, it is necessary to use a span to apply explicit layout attributes such as **LineHeight**, **BaselineShift**, or
                    **TextDecorationType** (see “Layout Attributes for ILSEs” in [14.8.5.4], “Layout Attributes”).<br />
                    NOTE 2 &emsp; Marked-content sequences having the tag Span are also used to carry certain accessibility properties (Alt, ActualText, Lang, and E; see [14.9], “Accessibility Support”). Such sequences lack an MCID property and are not
                    associated with any structure element. This use of the Span marked-content tag is distinct from its use as a structure type.

                    Elements”) as a child. The note may be included as a child of the structure element in the body text that refers to it, or it may be included elsewhere (such as in an endnotes section) and accessed by means of a reference (structure
                    type Reference).<br />
                    Tagged PDF does not prescribe the placement of footnotes in the page content order. They may be either inline or at the end of the page, at the discretion of the conforming writer.

**14.8.4.4.2 Link Elements**

=== "中文"

    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        Link annotations (like all PDF annotations) are associated with a geometric region of the page rather than with a particular object in its content stream. Any connection between the link and the content is based solely on visual appearance rather than on an explicitly specified association. For this reason, link annotations alone are not useful to users with visual impairments or to applications needing to determine which content can be activated to invoke a hypertext link.
    
    Tagged PDF link elements (structure type Link) use PDF’s logical structure facilities to establish the association between content items and link annotations, providing functionality comparable to HTML hypertext links. The following items may be children of a link element:
    
    - One or more content items or other ILSEs (except other links)
    - Object references (see [14.7.4.3], “PDF Objects as Content Items”) to one or more link annotations associated with the content
    
    When a **Link** structure element describes a span of text to be associated with a link annotation and that span wraps from the end of one line to the beginning of another, the **Link** structure element shall include a single object reference that associates the span with the associated link annotation. Further, the link annotation shall use the **QuadPoint** entry to denote the active areas on the page.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE 1"
    
        The **Link** structure element references a link annotation that includes a **QuadPoint** entry that boxes the strings “with a” and “link”. That is, the **QuadPoint** entry contains 16 numbers: the first 8 numbers describe a quadrilateral for “with a”, and the next 8 describe a quadrilateral for “link.”
    
            <p>Here is some text <span style="color:blue;text-decoration: underline blue;">with a linke</span> inside .</p>
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        Beginning with PDF 1.7, use of the Link structure element to enclose multiple link annotations is deprecated.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE 2"
    
        Consider the following fragment of HTML code, which produces a line of text containing a hypertext link:
    
        ```html
        <html>
            <body>
                <p>
                Here is some text <a href=http://www.adobe.com>with a link</a> inside .
            </body>
        </html>
        ```
    
        This code sample shows an equivalent fragment of PDF using a link element, whose text it displays in blue and underlined.

**14.8.4.4.3 Annotation Elements**

=== "中文"

    Tagged PDF annotation elements (structure type Annot; PDF 1.5) use PDF’s logical structure facilities to establish the association between content items and PDF annotations. Annotation elements shall be used for all types of annotations other than links (see “Link Elements” in [14.8.4.3], “Block-Level Structure Elements”) and forms (see [Table 340](#table340)).
    
    The following items may be children of an annotation element:
    
    - Object references (see [14.7.4.3], “PDF Objects as Content Items”) to one or more annotation dictionaries
    - Optionally, one or more content items (such as marked-content sequences) or other ILSEs (except other
    annotations) associated with the annotations
    
    If an Annot element has no children other than object references, its rendering shall be defined by the appearance of the referenced annotations, and its text content shall be treated as if it were a Span element. It may have an optional **BBox** attribute; if supplied, this attribute overrides the rectangle specified by the annotation dictionary’s **Rect** entry.
    
    If the Annot element has children that are content items, those children represent the displayed form of the annotation, and the appearance of the associated annotation may also be applied (for example, with a **Highlight** annotation).
    
    There may be multiple children that are object references to different annotations, subject to the constraint that the annotations shall be the same except for their **Rect** entry. This is much the same as is done for the Link element; it allows an annotation to be associated with discontiguous pieces of content, such as line-wrapped text.

**14.8.4.4.4 Ruby and Warichu Elements**

=== "中文"

    Ruby text is a side note, written in a smaller text size and placed adjacent to the base text to which it refers. It is used in Japanese and Chinese to describe the pronunciation of unusual words or to describe such items as abbreviations and logos.
    
    Warichu text is a comment or annotation, written in a smaller text size and formatted onto two smaller lines within the height of the containing text line and placed following (inline) the base text to which it refers. It is used in Japanese for descriptive comments and for ruby annotation text that is too long to be aesthetically formatted as a ruby.

**14.8.4.5 Illustration Elements**

=== "中文"

    Tagged PDF defines an *illustration element* as any structure element whose structure type (after role mapping, if any) is one of those listed in [Table 340](#table340). The illustration’s content shall consist of one or more complete graphics objects. It shall not appear between the **BT** and **ET** operators delimiting a text object (see [9.4], “Text Objects”). It may include clipping only in the form of a contained marked clipping sequence, as defined in [14.6.3], “Marked Content and Clipping.” In Tagged PDF, all such marked clipping sequences shall carry the marked-content tag Clip.

                    This structure type is useful only for identifying an entire content element as a formula. No standard structure types are defined for identifying individual components within the formula. From a formatting standpoint, the formula
                    shall be treated similarly to a figure (structure type Figure).

                <td>Form</td>
                <td>
                    (Form) A widget annotation representing an interactive form field (see [12.7], “Interactive Forms”). If the element contains a **Role** attribute, it may contain content items that represent the value of the (non-interactive) form
                    field. If the element omits a **Role** attribute (see Table 348), it shall have only one child: an object reference (see [14.7.4.3], “PDF Objects as Content Items”) identifying the widget annotation. The annotations’ appearance
                    stream (see [12.5.5], “Appearance Streams”) shall describe the appearance of the form element.

    An illustration may have logical substructure, including other illustrations. For purposes of reflow, however, it shall be moved (and perhaps resized) as a unit, without examining its internal contents. To be useful for reflow, it shall have a **BBox** attribute. It may also have **Placement**, **Width**, **Height**, and **BaselineShift** attributes (see [14.8.5.4], “Layout Attributes”).
    
    Often an illustration is logically part of, or at least attached to, a paragraph or other element of a document. Any such containment or attachment shall be represented through the use of the Figure structure type. The Figure element indicates the point of attachment, and its **Placement** attribute describes the nature of the attachment. An illustration element without a **Placement** attribute shall be treated as an ILSE and laid out inline.
    
    For accessibility to users with disabilities and other text extraction purposes, an illustration element should have an **Alt** entry or an **ActualText** entry (or both) in its structure element dictionary (see [14.9.3], “Alternate Descriptions,” and [14.9.4], “Replacement Text”). **Alt** is a description of the illustration, whereas **ActualText** gives the exact text equivalent of a graphical illustration that has the appearance of text.

**14.8.5 Standard Structure Attributes**

### 14.8.5.1 概述

**14.8.5.1 General**

=== "中文"

    In addition to the standard structure types, Tagged PDF defines standard layout and styling attributes for structure elements of those types. These attributes enable predictable formatting to be applied during operations such as reflow and export of PDF content to other document formats.
    
    As discussed in [14.7.5], “Structure Attributes,” attributes shall be defined in attribute objects, which are dictionaries or streams attached to a structure element in either of two ways:
    
    - The **A** entry in the structure element dictionary identifies an attribute object or an array of such objects.
    - The **C** entry in the structure element dictionary gives the name of an *attribute class* or an array of such names. The class name is in turn looked up in the *class map*, a dictionary identified by the **ClassMap** entry in the structure tree root, yielding an attribute object or array of objects corresponding to the class.
    
    In addition to the standard structure attributes described in [14.8.5.2], “Standard Attribute Owners,” there are several other optional entries—**Lang**, **Alt**, **ActualText**, and **E**—that are described in [14.9], “Accessibility Support,” but are useful to other PDF consumers as well. They appear in the following places in a PDF file (rather than in attribute dictionaries):
    
    - As entries in the structure element dictionary (see [Table 323](./s7.md#table323))
    - As entries in property lists attached to marked-content sequences with a Span tag (see [14.6], “Marked Content”)
    
    The Example in [14.7.6], “Example of Logical Structure,” illustrates the use of standard structure attributes.

    In addition to the standard structure attributes described in [14.8.5.2], “Standard Attribute Owners,” there are several other optional entries—**Lang**, **Alt**, **ActualText**, and **E**—that are described in [14.9], “Accessibility Support,” but are useful to other PDF consumers as well. They appear in the following places in a PDF file (rather than in attribute dictionaries):
    
    - As entries in the structure element dictionary (see [Table 323](./s7.md#table323))
    - As entries in property lists attached to marked-content sequences with a Span tag (see [14.6], “Marked Content”)
    
    The Example in [14.7.6], “Example of Logical Structure,” illustrates the use of standard structure attributes.

**14.8.5.2 Standard Attribute Owners**

=== "中文"

    Each attribute object has an *owner*, specified by the object’s **O** entry, which determines the interpretation of the attributes defined in the object’s dictionary. Multiple owners may define like-named attributes with different value types or interpretations. Tagged PDF defines a set of standard attribute owners, shown in [Table 341](#table341).

**14.8.5.3 Attribute Values and Inheritance**

=== "中文"

    Some attributes are defined as inheritable. Inheritable attributes propagate down the structure tree; that is, an attribute that is specified for an element shall apply to all the descendants of the element in the structure tree unless a descendent element specifies an explicit value for the attribute.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        The description of each of the standard attributes in this sub-clause specifies whether their values are inheritable.
    
    An inheritable attribute may be specified for an element for the purpose of propagating its value to child elements, even if the attribute is not meaningful for the parent element. Non-inheritable attributes may be specified only for elements on which they would be meaningful.
    
    The following list shows the priority for determining attribute values. A conforming reader determines an attribute’s value to be the first item in the following list that applies:
    
    a) The value of the attribute specified in the element’s **A** entry, owned by one of the export formats (such as **XML**, **HTML-3.20**, **HTML-4.01**, **OEB-1.0**, **CSS-1.00**, **CSS-2.0**, and **RTF**), if present, and if outputting to that format
    
    b) The value of the attribute specified in the element’s A entry, owned by Layout, PrintField, Table or List, if present
    
    c) The value of the attribute specified in a class map associated with the element’s **C** entry, if there is one
    
    d) The resolved value of the parent structure element, if the attribute is inheritable
    
    e) The default value for the attribute, if there is one
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        The attributes **Lang**, **Alt**, **ActualText**, and **E** do not appear in attribute dictionaries. The rules governing their application are discussed in [14.9], “Accessibility Support.”
    
    There is no semantic distinction between attributes that are specified explicitly and ones that are inherited. Logically, the structure tree has attributes fully bound to each element, even though some may be inherited from an ancestor element. This is consistent with the behaviour of properties (such as font characteristics) that are not specified by structure attributes but shall be derived from the content.

**14.8.5.4 Layout Attributes**

#### 14.8.5.4.1 概述

**14.8.5.4.1 General**

=== "中文"

    *Layout attributes* specify parameters of the layout process used to produce the appearance described by a document’s PDF content. Attributes in this category shall be defined in attribute objects whose O (owner) entry has the value **Layout** (or is one of the format-specific owner names listed in [Table 341](#table341)).
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
        The intent is that these parameters can be used to reflow the content or export it to some other document format with at least basic styling preserved.
    
    [Table 342](#table342) summarizes the standard layout attributes and the structure elements to which they apply. The following sub-clauses describe the meaning and usage of these attributes.
    
    As described in [14.8.5.3], “Attribute Values and Inheritance,” an inheritable attribute may be specified for any element to propagate it to descendants, regardless of whether it is meaningful for that element.

**14.8.5.4.2 General Layout Attributes**

=== "中文"

    The layout attributes described in [Table 343](#table343) may apply to structure elements of any of the standard types at the block level (BLSEs) or the inline level (ILSEs).

                    (Optional; not inheritable) The positioning of the element with respect to the enclosing reference area and other content: <br/> <br/>
                    Block &emsp; Stacked in the block-progression direction within an enclosing reference area or parent BLSE. <br/>
                    Inline &emsp; Packed in the inline-progression direction within an enclosing BLSE. <br/>
                    Before &emsp; Placed so that the before edge of the element’s allocation rectangle (see “Content and Allocation Rectangles” in [14.8.5.4], “Layout Attributes”) coincides with that of the nearest enclosing reference area. The element may float, if necessary, to achieve the specified placement. The element shall be treated as a block occupying the full extent of the enclosing reference area in the inline direction. Other content shall be stacked so as to begin at the after edge of the element’s allocation rectangle. <br/>
                    Start &emsp; Placed so that the start edge of the element’s allocation rectangle (see “Content and Allocation Rectangles” in [14.8.5.4], “Layout Attributes”) coincides with that of the nearest enclosing reference area. The element may float, if necessary, to achieve the specified placement. Other content that would intrude into the element’s allocation rectangle shall be laid out as a runaround. <br/>
                    End &emsp; Placed so that the end edge of the element’s allocation rectangle (see “Content and Allocation Rectangles” in [14.8.5.4], “Layout Attributes”) coincides with that of the nearest enclosing reference area. The element may float, if necessary, to achieve the specified placement. Other content that would intrude into the element’s allocation rectangle shall be laid out as a runaround. <br/>
                    When applied to an ILSE, any value except Inline shall cause the element to be treated as a BLSE instead. Default value: Inline. <br/>
                    Elements with **Placement** values of Before, Start, or End shall be removed from the normal stacking or packing process and allowed to float to the specified edge of the enclosing reference area or parent BLSE. Multiple such floating elements may be positioned adjacent to one another against the specified edge of the reference area or placed serially against the edge, in the order encountered. Complex cases such as floating elements that interfere with each other or do not fit on the same page may be handled differently by different conforming readers. Tagged PDF merely identifies the elements as floating and indicates their desired placement.

                    The specified layout directions shall apply to the given structure element and all of its descendants to any level of nesting. Default value: LrTb. <br/><br/>
                    For elements that produce multiple columns, the writing mode defines the direction of column progression within the reference area: the inline direction determines the stacking direction for columns and the default flow order of text from column to column. For tables, the writing mode controls the layout of rows and columns: table rows (structure type TR) shall be stacked in the block direction, cells within a row (structure type TD) in the inline direction.<br/><br/>
                    The inline-progression direction specified by the writing mode is subject to local override within the text being laid out, as described in Unicode Standard Annex #9, The Bidirectional Algorithm, available from the Unicode Consortium (see the [Bibliography](../bibliography.md)).

                - A name from the list below representing the border style to apply to all four edges.<br/>

                Hidden &emsp; Same as None, except in terms of border conflict resolution for table elements. <br/>
                Dotted &emsp;The border is a series of dots. <br/>
                Dashed &emsp;The border is a series of short line segments. <br/>
                Solid &emsp; The border is a single line segment. <br/>
                Double &emsp; The border is two solid lines. The sum of the two lines and the space between them equals the value of **BorderThickness**. <br/>
                Groove &emsp;The border looks as though it were carved into the canvas. <br/>
                Ridge &emsp;The border looks as though it were coming out of the canvas (the opposite of Groove). <br/>
                Inset &emsp; The border makes the entire box look as though it were embedded in the canvas. <br/>

                All borders shall be drawn on top of the box’s background. The colour of borders drawn for values of Groove, Ridge, Inset, and Outset shall depend on the structure element’s **BorderColor** attribute and the colour of the background over which the border is being drawn.<br/><br/>
                NOTE &emsp; Conforming HTML applications may interpret Dotted, Dashed, Double, Groove, Ridge, Inset, and Outset to be Solid.

A positive value enlarges the background area; a negative value trims it, possibly allowing the border to overlap the element’s text or graphic. <br/>
                    The value shall be either a single number representing the width of the padding, in default user space units, that applies to all four sides or a 4-element array of numbers representing the padding width for the before, after, start, and end edge, respectively, of the content rectangle. Default value: 0.</td>

                None &emsp; No border. Forces the computed value of BorderThickness to be 0. <br/>
                Hidden &emsp; Same as None, except in terms of border conflict resolution for table elements. <br/>
                Dotted &emsp;The border is a series of dots. <br/>
                Dashed &emsp;The border is a series of short line segments. <br/>
                Solid &emsp; The border is a single line segment. <br/>
                Double &emsp; The border is two solid lines. The sum of the two lines and the space between them equals the value of **BorderThickness**. <br/>
                Groove &emsp;The border looks as though it were carved into the canvas. <br/>
                Ridge &emsp;The border looks as though it were coming out of the canvas (the opposite of Groove). <br/>
                Inset &emsp; The border makes the entire box look as though it were embedded in the canvas. <br/>
                Outset &emsp;The border makes the entire box look as though it were coming out of the canvas (the opposite of Inset). <br/><br/>

    [Table 344](#table344) describes layout attributes that shall apply only to block-level structure elements (BLSEs).
    
    Inline-level structure elements (ILSEs) with a **Placement** attribute other than the default value of Inline shall be treated as BLSEs and shall also be subject to the attributes described here.

**14.8.5.4.4 Layout Attributes for ILSEs**

=== "中文"

    The attributes described in [Table 345](#table345) apply to inline-level structure elements (ILSEs). They may also be specified for a block-level element (BLSE) and may apply to any content items that are its immediate children.

                <td>(Optional; not inheritable) The distance, in default user space units, by which the element’s baseline shall be shifted relative to that of its parent element. The shift direction shall be the opposite of the block-progression direction specified by the prevailing **WritingMode** attribute (see “[General Layout Attributes](#148542-通用布局属性)” in [14.8.5.4], “Layout Attributes”). Thus, positive values shall shift the baseline toward the before edge and negative values toward the after edge of the reference area (upward and downward, respectively, in Western writing systems). Default value: 0. <br/><br/>
                    The shifted element may be a superscript, a subscript, or an inline graphic. The shift shall apply to the element, its content, and all of its descendants. Any further baseline shift applied to a child of this element shall be measured relative to the shifted baseline of this (parent) element.</td>

                <td>
                    (Optional; inheritable) The element’s preferred height, measured in default user space units in the block-progression direction. The height of a line shall be determined by the largest **LineHeight** value for any complete or partial ILSE that it contains. <br/>
                    The name Normal or Auto in place of a numeric value shall indicate that no specific height constraint is to be imposed. The element’s height shall be set to a reasonable value based on the content’s font size: <br/><br/>
                    Normal &emsp; Adjust the line height to include any nonzero value specified for **BaselineShift**.<br/>

                    This attribute applies to all ILSEs (including implicit ones) that are children of this element or of its nested ILSEs, if any. It shall not apply to nested BLSEs.<br/>
                    When translating to a specific export format, the values Normal and Auto, if specified, shall be used directly if they are available in the target format. The meaning of the term “reasonable value” is left to the conforming reader to determine. It should be approximately 1.2 times the font size, but this value can vary depending on the export format.<br/><br/>
                    NOTE 1 &emsp; In the absence of a numeric value for **LineHeight** or an explicit value for the font size, a reasonable method of calculating the line height from the information in a Tagged PDF file is to find the difference between the associated font’s **Ascent** and **Descent** values (see [9.8], “Font Descriptors”), map it from glyph space to default user space (see 9.4.4, “Text Space Details”), and use the maximum resulting value for any character in the line.

                    AutoSpecifies a default orientation for text, depending on whether it is fullwidth (as wide as it is high). Fullwidth Latin and fullwidth ideographic text (excluding ideographic punctuation) shall be set with an angle of 0. Ideographic punctuation and other ideographic characters having alternate horizontal and vertical forms shall use the vertical form of the glyph. Non-fullwidth text shall be set with an angle of 90.<br/>
                    Default value: Auto.<br/>
                    NOTE 2 &emsp; This attribute is used most commonly to differentiate between the preferred orientation of alphabetic (non- ideographic) text in vertically written Japanese documents (Auto or 90) and the orientation of the ideographic characters and/or alphabetic (non- ideographic) text in western signage and advertising (90). <br/>
                    This attribute shall affect both the alignment and width of the glyphs. If a glyph is perpendicular to the vertical baseline, its horizontal alignment point shall be aligned with the alignment baseline for the script to which the glyph belongs. The width of the glyph area shall be determined from the horizontal width font characteristic for the glyph.

**14.8.5.4.5 Content and Allocation Rectangles**

=== "中文"

    As defined in [14.8.3], “Basic Layout Model,” an element’s *content rectangle* is an enclosing rectangle derived from the shape of the element’s content, which shall define the bounds used for the layout of any included child elements. The *allocation rectangle* includes any additional borders or spacing surrounding the element, affecting how it shall be positioned with respect to adjacent elements and the enclosing content rectangle or reference area.
    
    The exact definition of the content rectangle shall depend on the element’s structure type:
    
    - For a table cell (structure type TH or TD), the content rectangle shall be determined from the bounding box of all graphics objects in the cell’s content, taking into account any explicit bounding boxes (such as the **BBox** entry in a form XObject). This implied size may be explicitly overridden by the cell’s **Width** and **Height** attributes. The cell’s height shall be adjusted to equal the maximum height of any cell in its row; its width shall be adjusted to the maximum width of any cell in its column.
    - For any other BLSE, the height of the content rectangle shall be the sum of the heights of all BLSEs it contains, plus any additional spacing adjustments between these elements.
    - For an ILSE that contains text, the height of the content rectangle shall be set by the **LineHeight** attribute. The width shall be determined by summing the widths of the contained characters, adjusted for any indents, letter spacing, word spacing, or line-end conditions.
    - For an ILSE that contains an illustration or table, the content rectangle shall be determined from the bounding box of all graphics objects in the content, and shall take into account any explicit bounding boxes (such as the **BBox** entry in a form XObject). This implied size may be explicitly overridden by the element’s **Width** and **Height** attributes.
    - For an ILSE that contains a mixture of elements, the height of the content rectangle shall be determined by aligning the child objects relative to one another based on their text baseline (for text ILSEs) or end edge (for non-text ILSEs), along with any applicable **BaselineShift** attribute (for all ILSEs), and finding the extreme top and bottom for all elements.
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
        Some conforming readers may apply this process to all elements within the block; others may apply it on a line-by-line basis.
    
    The allocation rectangle shall be derived from the content rectangle in a way that also depends on the structure type:
    
    - For a BLSE, the allocation rectangle shall be equal to the content rectangle with its before and after edges adjusted by the element’s **SpaceBefore** and **SpaceAfter** attributes, if any, but with no changes to the start and end edges.
    - For an ILSE, the allocation rectangle is the same as the content rectangle.

**14.8.5.4.6 Illustration Attributes**

=== "中文"

    Particular uses of illustration elements (structure types Figure, Formula, or Form) shall have additional restrictions:
    
    - When an illustration element has a **Placement** attribute of Block, it shall have a **Height** attribute with an explicitly specified numerical value (not Auto). This value shall be the sole source of information about the illustration’s extent in the block-progression direction.
    - When an illustration element has a **Placement** attribute of Inline, it shall have a **Width** attribute with an explicitly specified numerical value (not Auto). This value shall be the sole source of information about the illustration’s extent in the inline-progression direction.
    - When an illustration element has a **Placement** attribute of Inline, Start, or End, the value of its **BaselineShift** attribute shall be used to determine the position of its after edge relative to the text baseline; **BaselineShift** shall be ignored for all other values of **Placement**. (An illustration element with a **Placement** value of Start may be used to create a dropped capital; one with a **Placement** value of Inline may be used to create a raised capital.)

**14.8.5.6 PrintField Attributes**

=== "中文"

    (PDF 1.7) The attributes described in [Table 348](#table348) identify the role of fields in non-interactive PDF forms. Such forms may have originally contained interactive fields such as text fields and radio buttons but were then converted into non-interactive PDF files, or they may have been designed to be printed out and filled in manually. Since the roles of the fields cannot be determined from interactive elements, the roles are defined using PrintField attributes.
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
        PrintField attributes enable screen readers to identify page content that represents form fields (radio buttons, check boxes, push buttons, and text fields). These attributes enable the controls in print form fields to be represented in the logical structure tree and to be presented to assistive technology as if they were read-only interactive fields.
