**14.3 Metadata**

## 14.3.1 概述

**14.3.1 General**

=== "中文"

    A PDF document may include general information, such as the document’s title, author, and creation and modification dates. Such global information about the document (as opposed to its content or structure) is called *metadata* and is intended to assist in cataloguing and searching for documents in external databases. Beginning with PDF 1.4, metadata may also be specified for individual components of a document.
    
    Metadata may be stored in a PDF document in either of the following ways:
    
    - In a *metadata stream* (PDF 1.4) associated with the document or a component of the document ([14.3.2], “Metadata Streams”)
    - In a *document information dictionary* associated with the document ([14.3.3], “Document Information Dictionary”)
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
        Document information dictionaries is the original way that metadata was included in a PDF file. Metadata streams were introduced in PDF 1.4 and is now the preferred method to include metadata.

**14.3.2 Metadata Streams**

=== "中文"

    Metadata, both for an entire document and for components within a document, may be stored in PDF streams
    called *metadata* streams (PDF 1.4).
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        Metadata streams have the following advantages over the document information dictionary:
    
        - PDF-based workflows often embed metadata-bearing artwork as components within larger documents. Metadata streams provide a standard way of preserving the metadata of these components for examination downstream. PDF-aware conforming products should be able to derive a list of all metadata- bearing document components from the PDF document itself.
        - PDF documents are often made available on the Web or in other environments, where many tools routinely examine, catalogue, and classify documents. These tools should be able to understand the self-contained description of the document even if they do not understand PDF.
    
    Besides the usual entries common to all stream dictionaries (see [Table 5](../c7/s3.md#table5)), the metadata stream dictionary shall contain the additional entries listed in [Table 315](#table315).
    
    The contents of a metadata stream shall be the metadata represented in Extensible Markup Language (XML).
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        This information is visible as plain text to tools that are not PDF-aware only if the metadata stream is both unfiltered and unencrypted.
    
    <table id="table315" markdown="span">

    !!! note "NOTE 3"
    
        The format of the XML representing the metadata is defined as part of a framework called the Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) and described in the Adobe document *XMP: Extensible Metadata Platform* (see the [Bibliography](../bibliography.md)). This framework provides a way to use XML to represent metadata describing documents and their components and is intended to be adopted by a wider class of products than just those that process PDF. It includes a method to embed XML data within non-XML data files in a platform-independent format that can be easily located and accessed by simple scanning rather than requiring the document file to be parsed.
    
    A metadata stream may be attached to a document through the **Metadata** entry in the document catalogue (see [7.7.2], “Document Catalog”). The metadata framework provides a date stamp for metadata expressed in the framework. If this date stamp is equal to or later than the document modification date recorded in the document information dictionary, the metadata stream shall be taken as authoritative. If, however, the document modification date recorded in the document information dictionary is later than the metadata stream’s date stamp, the document has likely been saved by a writer that is not aware of metadata streams. In this case, information stored in the document information dictionary shall be taken to override any semantically equivalent items in the metadata stream. In addition, PDF document components represented as a stream or dictionary may have a **Metadata** entry (see [Table 316](#table316)).
    
    <table id="table316" markdown="span">
        <caption>**Table 316 – Additional entry for components having metadata**</caption>

            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    
    In general, any PDF stream or dictionary may have metadata attached to it as long as the stream or dictionary represents an actual information resource, as opposed to serving as an implementation artifact. Some PDF constructs are considered implementational, and hence may not have associated metadata.
    
    When there is ambiguity about exactly which stream or dictionary may bear the **Metadata** entry, the metadata shall be attached as close as possible to the object that actually stores the data resource described.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 4"
    
        Metadata describing a tiling pattern should be attached to the pattern stream’s dictionary, but a shading should have metadata attached to the shading dictionary rather than to the shading pattern dictionary that refers to it. Similarly, metadata describing an **ICCBased** colour space should be attached to the ICC profile stream describing it, and metadata for fonts should be attached to font file streams rather than to font dictionaries.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 5"
    
        In tables describing document components in this specification, the **Metadata** entry is listed only for those in which it is most likely to be used. Keep in mind, however, that this entry may appear in other components represented as streams or dictionaries.
    
    - In addition, metadata may also be associated with marked content within a content stream. This association shall be created by including an entry in the property list dictionary whose key shall be **Metadata** and whose value shall be the metadata stream dictionary. Because this construct refers to an object outside the content stream, the property list is referred to indirectly as a named resource (see [14.6.2], “Property Lists”).
