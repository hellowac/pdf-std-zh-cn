=== "中文"

    The features described in this clause do not affect the final appearance of a document. Rather, these features enable a document to include higher-level information that is useful for the interchange of documents among conforming products:
    
    - Procedure sets ([14.2], “Procedure Sets”) that define the implementation of PDF operators
    - Metadata ([14.3], “Metadata”) consisting of general information about a document or a component of a document, such as its title, author, and creation and modification dates
    - File identifiers ([14.4], “File Identifiers”) for reliable reference from one PDF file to another
    - Page-piece dictionaries ([14.5], “Page-Piece Dictionaries”) allowing a conforming product to embed private data in a PDF document for its own use
    - Marked-content operators ([14.6], “Marked Content”) for identifying portions of a content stream and associating them with additional properties or externally specified objects
    - Logical structure facilities ([14.7], “Logical Structure”) for imposing a hierarchical organization on the content of a document
    - Tagged PDF ([14.8], “Tagged PDF”), a set of conventions for using the marked content and logical structure facilities to facilitate the extraction and reuse of a document’s content for other purposes
    - Various ways of increasing the accessibility of a document to users with disabilities ([14.9], “Accessibility Support”), including the identification of the natural language in which it is written (such as English or Spanish) for the benefit of a text-to-speech engine
    - The Web Capture extension ([14.10], “ Web Capture”), which creates PDF files from Internet-based or locally resident HTML, PDF, GIF, JPEG, and ASCII text files
    - Facilities supporting prepress production workflows ([14.11], “Prepress Support”), such as the specification of page boundaries and the generation of printer’s marks, colour separations, output intents, traps, and low-resolution proxies for high-resolution images
