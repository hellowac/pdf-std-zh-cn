## 14.6.1 概述

**14.6.1 General**

=== "中文"

    *Marked-content operators* (PDF 1.2) may identify a portion of a PDF content stream as a marked-content element of interest to a particular conforming product. Marked-content elements and the operators that mark them shall fall into two categories:
    
    - The **MP** and **DP** operators shall designate a single *marked-content point* in the content stream.
    - The **BMC**, **BDC**, and **EMC** operators shall bracket a *marked-content sequence* of objects within the content stream.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        This is a sequence not simply of bytes in the content stream but of complete graphics objects. Each object is fully qualified by the parameters of the graphics state in which it is rendered.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        A graphics application, for example, might use marked content to identify a set of related objects as a group to be processed as a single unit. A text-processing application might use it to maintain a connection between a footnote marker in the body of a document and the corresponding footnote text at the bottom of the page. The PDF logical structure facilities use marked-content sequences to associate graphical content with structure elements (see [14.7.4], “Structure Content”). [Table 320](#table320) summarizes the marked-content operators.
    
    All marked-content operators except EMC shall take a tag operand indicating the role or significance of the marked-content element to the conforming reader. All such tags shall be registered with Adobe Systems (see [Annex E](../a5.md)) to avoid conflicts between different applications marking the same content stream. In addition to the tag operand, the **DP** and **BDC** operators shall specify a property list containing further information associated with the marked content. Property lists are discussed further in [14.6.2], “Property Lists.”
    
    Marked-content operators may appear only between graphics objects in the content stream. They may not occur within a graphics object or between a graphics state operator and its operands. Marked-content sequences may be nested one within another, but each sequence shall be entirely contained within a single content stream.
    
    !!! note  "NOTE 3"
    
        A marked-content sequence may not cross page boundaries.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 4"
    
        The **Contents** entry of a page object (see [7.7.3.3], “Page Objects”), which may be either a single stream or an array of streams, is considered a single stream with respect to marked-content sequences.

**14.6.2 Property Lists**

=== "中文"

    The marked-content operators **DP** and **BDC** associate a property list with a marked-content element within a content stream. The property list is a dictionary containing private information meaningful to the conforming writer creating the marked content. Conforming products should use the dictionary entries in a consistent way; the values associated with a given key should always be of the same type (or small set of types).
    
    If all of the values in a property list dictionary are direct objects, the dictionary may be written inline in the content stream as a direct object. If any of the values are indirect references to objects outside the content stream, the property list dictionary shall be defined as a named resource in the **Properties** subdictionary of the current resource dictionary (see [7.8.3], “Resource Dictionaries”) and referenced by name as the properties operand of the **DP** or **BDC** operator.

**14.6.3 Marked Content and Clipping**

=== "中文"

    Some PDF path and text objects are defined purely for their effect on the current clipping path, without the objects actually being painted on the page. This occurs when a path object is defined using the operator sequence **W** n or **W\* n** (see [8.5.4], “Clipping Path Operators”) or when a text object is painted in text rendering mode 7 (see [9.3.6], “Text Rendering Mode”). Such clipped, unpainted path or text objects are called clipping objects. When a clipping object falls within a marked-content sequence, it shall not be considered part of the sequence unless the entire sequence consists only of clipping objects. In Example 1, for instance, the marked- content sequence tagged Clip includes the text string ( Clip me ) but not the rectangular path that defines the clipping boundary.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE 1"
    
        ```text
        /Clip BMC
            100 100 10 10 re W n        % Clipping path
            ( Clip me ) Tj              % Object to be clipped
        EMC
        ```
    
    
    Only when a marked-content sequence consists entirely of clipping objects shall the clipping objects be considered part of the sequence. In this case, the sequence is known as a marked clipping sequence. Such sequences may be nested. In Example 2, for instance, multiple lines of text are used to clip a subsequent graphics object (in this case, a filled path). Each line of text shall be bracketed within a separate marked clipping sequence, tagged Pgf. The entire series shall be bracketed in turn by an outer marked clipping sequence, tagged Clip.
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
        The marked-content sequence tagged ClippedText is not a marked clipping sequence, since it contains a filled rectangular path that is not a clipping object. The clipping objects belonging to the Clip and Pgf sequences are therefore not considered part of the ClippedText sequence.
    
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE 2"

        EMC
        ```
    
    The precise rules governing marked clipping sequences shall be as follows:
    
    - A *clipping object* shall be a path object ended by the operator sequence **W n** or **W\* n** or a text object painted in text rendering mode 7.
    - An *invisible graphics object* shall be a path object ended by the operator **n** only (with no preceding **W** or **W\***) or a text object painted in text rendering mode 3.
    - A *visible graphics object* shall be a path object ended by any operator other than n, a text object painted in any text rendering mode other than 3 or 7, or any XObject invoked by the **Do** operator.
    - An *empty marked-content element* shall be a marked-content point or a marked-content sequence that encloses no graphics objects.
    - A *marked clipping sequence* shall be a marked-content sequence that contains at least one clipping object and no visible graphics objects.
    -  Clipping objects and marked clipping sequences shall be considered part of an enclosing marked-content sequence only if it is a marked clipping sequence.
    - Invisible graphics objects and empty marked-content elements shall always be considered part of an enclosing marked-content sequence, regardless of whether it is a marked clipping sequence.
    - The **q** (save) and **Q** (restore) operators may not occur within a marked clipping sequence.
    
    Example 3 illustrates the application of these rules. Marked-content sequence S4 is a marked clipping sequence because it contains a clipping object (clipping path 2) and no visible graphics objects. Clipping path 2 is therefore considered part of sequence S4. Marked-content sequences S1, S2, and S3 are *not* marked clipping sequences, since they each include at least one visible graphics object. Thus, clipping paths 1 and 2 are not part of any of these three sequences.

        EMC
        ```
    
    In Example 4 marked-content sequence S1 is a marked clipping sequence because the only graphics object it contains is a clipping path. Thus, the empty marked-content sequence S3 and the marked-content point P1 are both part of sequence S2, and S2, S3, and P1 are all part of sequence S1.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE 4"

            EMC
        EMC
        ```
    
    In Example 5 marked-content sequences S1 and S4 are marked clipping sequences because the only object they contain is a clipping path. Hence the clipping path is part of sequences S1 and S4; S3 is part of S2; and S2, S3, and S4 are all part of S1.

    - An *invisible graphics object* shall be a path object ended by the operator **n** only (with no preceding **W** or **W\***) or a text object painted in text rendering mode 3.
    - A *visible graphics object* shall be a path object ended by any operator other than n, a text object painted in any text rendering mode other than 3 or 7, or any XObject invoked by the **Do** operator.
    - An *empty marked-content element* shall be a marked-content point or a marked-content sequence that encloses no graphics objects.
    - A *marked clipping sequence* shall be a marked-content sequence that contains at least one clipping object and no visible graphics objects.
    -  Clipping objects and marked clipping sequences shall be considered part of an enclosing marked-content sequence only if it is a marked clipping sequence.
    - Invisible graphics objects and empty marked-content elements shall always be considered part of an enclosing marked-content sequence, regardless of whether it is a marked clipping sequence.
    - The **q** (save) and **Q** (restore) operators may not occur within a marked clipping sequence.
    
    Example 3 illustrates the application of these rules. Marked-content sequence S4 is a marked clipping sequence because it contains a clipping object (clipping path 2) and no visible graphics objects. Clipping path 2 is therefore considered part of sequence S4. Marked-content sequences S1, S2, and S3 are *not* marked clipping sequences, since they each include at least one visible graphics object. Thus, clipping paths 1 and 2 are not part of any of these three sequences.

    In Example 4 marked-content sequence S1 is a marked clipping sequence because the only graphics object it contains is a clipping path. Thus, the empty marked-content sequence S3 and the marked-content point P1 are both part of sequence S2, and S2, S3, and P1 are all part of sequence S1.

    In Example 5 marked-content sequences S1 and S4 are marked clipping sequences because the only object they contain is a clipping path. Hence the clipping path is part of sequences S1 and S4; S3 is part of S2; and S2, S3, and S4 are all part of S1.
