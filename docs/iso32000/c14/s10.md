    The information in the Web Capture data structures enables conforming products to perform the following operations:
    
    - Save locally and preserve the visual appearance of material from the Web
    - Retrieve additional material from the Web and add it to an existing PDF file
    - Update or modify existing material previously captured from the Web
    - Find source information for material captured from the Web, such as the URL (if any) from which it was captured
    - Find all material in a PDF file that was generated from a given URL
    - Find all material in a PDF file that matches a given digital identifier (MD5 hash)
    
    The information needed to perform these operations shall be recorded in two data structures in the PDF file:
    
    - The *Web Capture information dictionary*, which shall hold document-level information related to Web Capture.
    - The *Web Capture content database*, which shall hold a complete registry of the source content resources retrieved by Web Capture and where it came from.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 3"
    
        The *Web Capture content database* enables the capturing process to avoid downloading material that is already present in the file.

**14.10.3 Content Database**

### 14.10.3.1 概述

**14.10.3.1 General**

=== "中文"

    When a PDF file, or part of a PDF file, is built from a content resource stored in another format, such as an HTML page, the resulting PDF file (or portion thereof) may contain content from more than the single content resources. Conversely, since many content formats do not have static pagination, a single content resource may give rise to multiple PDF pages.
    
    To keep track of the correspondence between PDF content and the resources from which the content was derived, a PDF file may contain a *content database* that maps URLs and digital identifiers to PDF objects such as pages and XObjects.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 4"
    
        By looking up digital identifiers in the database, Web Capture can determine whether newly downloaded content is identical to content already retrieved from a different URL. Thus, it can perform optimizations such as storing only one copy of an image that is referenced by multiple HTML pages.
    
    Web Capture’s content database shall be organized into *content sets*. Each content set shall be a dictionary holding information about a group of related PDF objects generated from the same source data. A content set shall have for the value of its **S** (subtype) entry either the value SPS, for a page set, or SIS, for an image set.
    
    The mapping from a source content resource to a content set in a PDF document may be saved in the PDF file. The mapping may be an association from the resource's URL to the content set, stored in the PDF document's URLS name tree. The mapping may also be an association from a digital identifier ([14.10.3.3], “Digital Identifiers”) generated from resource's data to the content set, stored in the PDF document's IDS name tree. Both associations may be present in the PDF file.
    
    ![123](./imgs/f84.png)
    
    Entries in the **URLS** and **IDS** name trees may refer to an array of content sets or a single content set. If the entry is an array, the content sets need not have the same subtype; the array may include both page sets and image sets.

### 14.10.3.2 URL 字符串

**14.10.3.2 URL Strings**

=== "中文"

    URLs associated with Web Capture content sets shall be reduced to a predictable, canonical form before being used as keys in the **URLS** name tree. The following steps describe how to perform this reduction, using terminology from Internet RFCs 1738, *Uniform Resource Locators*, and 1808, *Relative Uniform Resource Locators* (see the [Bibliography](../bibliography.md)). This algorithm shall be applied for HTTP, FTP, and file URLs:
    
    **Algorithm: URL strings**
    
    a) If the URL is relative, it shall be converted into an absolute URL.
    b) If the URL contains one or more NUMBER SIGN (02h3) characters, it shall be truncated before the first NUMBER SIGN.
    c) Any uppercase ASCII characters within the scheme section of the URL shall be replaced with the corresponding lowercase ASCII characters.
    d) If there is a host section, any uppercase ASCII characters therein shall be converted to lowercase ASCII.
    e) If the scheme is file and the host is localhost, the host section shall be removed.
    f) If there is a port section and the port is the default port for the given protocol (80 for HTTP or 21 for FTP), the port section shall be removed.
    g) If the path section contains PERIOD (2Eh) ( . ) or DOUBLE PERIOD ( . . ) subsequences, transform the path as described in section 4 of RFC 1808.
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
        Because the PERCENT SIGN (25h) is unsafe according to RFC 1738 and is also the escape character for encoded characters, it is not possible in general to distinguish a URL with unencoded characters from one with encoded characters. For example, it is impossible to decide whether the sequence %00 represents a single encoded null character or a sequence of three unencoded characters. Hence, no number of encoding or decoding passes on a URL can ever cause it to reach a stable state. Empirically, URLs embedded in HTML files have unsafe characters encoded with one encoding pass, and Web servers perform one decoding pass on received paths (though CGI scripts can make their own decisions).
    
    Canonical URLs are thus assumed to have undergone one and only one encoding pass. A URL whose initial encoding state is known can be safely transformed into a URL that has undergone only one encoding pass.

### 14.10.3.3 数字标识符

**14.10.3.3 Digital Identifiers**

=== "中文"

    Digital identifiers, used to associate source content resources with content sets by the **IDS** name tree, shall be generated using the MD5 message-digest algorithm (Internet RFC 1321).
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        The exact data passed to the algorithm depends on the type of content set and the nature of the identifier being calculated.
    
    For a page set, the source data shall be passed to the MD5 algorithm first, followed by strings representing the digital identifiers of any auxiliary data files (such as images) referenced in the source data, in the order in which they are first referenced. If an auxiliary file is referenced more than once, its identifier shall be passed only the first time. The resulting string shall be used as the digital identifier for the source content resource.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        This sequence produces a composite identifier representing the visual appearance of the pages in the page set.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 3"
    
        Two HTML source files that are identical, but for which the referenced images contain different data—for example, if they have been generated by a script or are pointed to by relative URLs—do not produce the same identifier.
    
    When the source data is a PDF file, the identifier shall be generated solely from the contents of that file; there shall be no auxiliary data.
    
    A page set may also have a text identifier, calculated by applying the MD5 algorithm to just the text present in the source data.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE 1"
    
        For an HTML file the text identifier is based solely on the text between markup tags; no images are used
    in the calculation.
    
    For an image set, the digital identifier shall be calculated by passing the source data for the original image to
    the MD5 algorithm.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE 2"
    
        The identifier for an image set created from a GIF image is calculated from the contents of the GIF.

### 14.10.3.4 唯一名称生成

**14.10.3.4 Unique Name Generation**

=== "中文"

    In generating PDF pages from a data source, items such as hypertext links and HTML form fields are converted into corresponding named destinations and interactive form fields. These items shall be given names that do not conflict with those of other such items in the file.
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
        As used here, the term name refers to a string, not a name object.
    
    Furthermore, when updating an existing file, a conforming processor shall ensure that each destination or field is given a unique name that shall be derived from its original name but constructed so that it avoids conflicts with similarly named items elsewhere.
    
    The unique name shall be formed by appending an encoded form of the page set’s digital identifier string to the original name of the destination or field. The identifier string shall be encoded to remove characters that have special meaning in destinations and fields. The characters listed in the first column of [Table 351](#table351) have special meaning and shall be encoded using the corresponding byte values from second column of [Table 351](#table351).

Each byte in the source string, encoded as described previously, shall be replaced by two bytes in the destination string. The first byte in each pair is 65 (corresponding to the ASCII character A) plus the high-order 4 bits of the source byte; the second byte is 65 plus the low-order 4 bits of the source byte.

### 14.10.4.2 页面集

**14.10.4.2 Page Sets**

=== "中文"
    
    A page set is a content set containing a group of PDF page objects generated from a common source, such as an HTML file. The pages shall be listed in the **O** array of the page set dictionary (see [Table 352](#table352)) in the same order in which they were initially added to the file. A single page object shall not belong to more than one page set. [Table 353](#table353) defines the content set dictionary entries specific to Page Sets.
    
    The TID (text identifier) entry may be used to store an identifier generated from the text of the pages belonging to the page set (see [14.10.3.3], “Digital Identifiers”). A text identifier may not be appropriate for some page sets (such as those with no text) and may be omitted in these cases.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE"
    
        This identifier may be used to determine whether the text of a document has changed.

    A page set is a content set containing a group of PDF page objects generated from a common source, such as an HTML file. The pages shall be listed in the **O** array of the page set dictionary (see [Table 352](#table352)) in the same order in which they were initially added to the file. A single page object shall not belong to more than one page set. [Table 353](#table353) defines the content set dictionary entries specific to Page Sets.
    
    The TID (text identifier) entry may be used to store an identifier generated from the text of the pages belonging to the page set (see [14.10.3.3], “Digital Identifiers”). A text identifier may not be appropriate for some page sets (such as those with no text) and may be omitted in these cases.

    An *image set* is a content set containing a group of image XObjects generated from a common source, such as multiple frames of an animated GIF image. A single XObject shall not belong to more than one image set. [Table 354](#table354) shows the content set dictionary entries specific to Image Sets.

        </tbody>
    </table>
    
    
    Each image XObject in an image set has a reference count indicating the number of PDF pages referring to that XObject. The reference count shall be incremented whenever Web Capture creates a new page referring to the XObject (including copies of already existing pages) and decremented whenever such a page is destroyed. The reference count shall be incremented or decremented only once per page, regardless of the number of times the XObject may be referenced by that page. If the reference count reaches 0, it shall be assumed that there are no remaining pages referring to the XObject and that the XObject can be removed from the image set’s **O** array. When removing an XObject from the O array of an image set, the corresponding entry in the R array shall be removed also.

    A content set's **SI** entry may contain a single source information dictionary. However, a PDF processor may attempt to detect situations in which the same source data has been located via two or more distinct URLs. If a processor detects such a situation, it may generate a single content set from the source data, containing a single copy of the relevant PDF pages or image XObjects. In this case, the **SI** entry shall be an array containing one source information dictionary for each distinct URL from which the original source content was found.
    
    The determination that distinct URLs produce the same source data shall be made by comparing digital identifiers for the source data.
    
    A source information dictionary’s **AU** (aliased URLs) entry shall identify the URLs from which the source data was retrieved. If there is only one such URL, the v value of this entry may be a string. If multiple URLs map to the same location through redirection, the **AU** value shall be a URL alias dictionary (see [14.10.5.2], “URL Alias Dictionaries”).
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1" 
    
        For file size efficiency, the entire URL alias dictionary (excluding the URL strings) should be represented as a direct object because its internal structure should never be shared or externally referenced.
    
    The **TS** (time stamp) entry allows each source location associated with a content set to have its own time stamp.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        This is necessary because the time stamp in the content set dictionary (see [Table 352](#table352)) merely refers to the creation date of the content set. A hypothetical “Update Content Set” command might reset the time stamp in the source information dictionary to the current time if it found that the source data had not changed since the time stamp was last set.
    
    The **E** (expiration) entry specifies an expiration date for each source location associated with a content set. If the current date and time are later than those specified, the contents of the content set shall be considered out of date with respect to the original source.

### 14.10.5.2 URL 别名字典

**14.10.5.2 URL Alias Dictionaries**

=== "中文"

    When a URL is accessed via HTTP, a response header may be returned indicating that the requested data is at a different URL. This *redirection* process may be repeated in turn at the new URL and can potentially continue indefinitely. It is not uncommon to find multiple URLs that all lead eventually to the same destination through one or more redirections. A URL alias dictionary represents such a set of URL chains leading to a common destination. [Table 356](#table356) shows the contents of this type of dictionary.

    When a URL is accessed via HTTP, a response header may be returned indicating that the requested data is at a different URL. This *redirection* process may be repeated in turn at the new URL and can potentially continue indefinitely. It is not uncommon to find multiple URLs that all lead eventually to the same destination through one or more redirections. A URL alias dictionary represents such a set of URL chains leading to a common destination. [Table 356](#table356) shows the contents of this type of dictionary.

**14.10.5.3 Command Dictionaries**

=== "中文"

    A Web Capture *command dictionary* represents a command executed by Web Capture to retrieve one or more pieces of source data that were used to create new pages or modify existing pages. The entries in this dictionary represent parameters that were originally specified interactively by the user who requested that the Web content be captured. This information is recorded so that the command can subsequently be repeated to update the captured content. [Table 357](#table357) shows the contents of this type of dictionary.

## 14.10.6 与网页捕获相关的对象属性

**14.10.6 Object Attributes Related to Web Capture**

=== "中文"

    A given page object or image XObject may belong to at most one Web Capture content set, called its parent content set. However, the object shall not have direct pointer to its parent content set. Such a pointer may present problems for an application that traces all pointers from an object to determine what resources the object depends on. Instead, the object’s **ID** entry (see [Table 30](../c7/s7.md#table30) and [Table 89](../c8/s9.md#table89)) contains the digital identifier of the parent content set, which shall be used to locate the parent content set via the **IDS** name tree in the document’s name dictionary. (If the **IDS** entry for the identifier contains an array of content sets, the parent may be found by searching the array for the content set whose **O** entry includes the child object.)
    
    In the course of creating PDF pages from HTML files, Web Capture frequently scales the contents down to fit on fixed-sized pages. The **PZ** (preferred zoom) entry in a page object (see [7.7.3.3], “Page Objects”) specifies a magnification factor by which the page may be scaled to undo the downscaling and view the page at its original size. That is, when the page is viewed at the preferred magnification factor, one unit in default user space corresponds to one original source pixel.
