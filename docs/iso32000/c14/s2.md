**14.2 Procedure Sets**

=== "中文"
    
    The PDF operators used in content streams are grouped into categories of related operators called procedure sets (see [Table 314](#table314)). Each procedure set corresponds to a named resource containing the implementations of the operators in that procedure set. The **ProcSet** entry in a content stream’s resource dictionary (see [7.8.3], “Resource Dictionaries”) shall hold an array consisting of the names of the procedure sets used in that content stream. These procedure sets shall be used only when the content stream is printed to a PostScript output device. The names identify PostScript procedure sets that shall be sent to the device to interpret the PDF operators in the content stream. Each element of this array shall be one of the predefined names shown in [Table 314](#table314).

    Beginning with PDF 1.4, this feature is considered obsolete. For compatibility with existing conforming readers, conforming writers should continue to specify procedure sets (preferably, all of those listed in [Table 314](#table314) unless it is known that fewer are needed). However, conforming readers should not depend on the correctness of this information.
