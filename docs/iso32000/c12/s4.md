**12.4.1 General**

=== "中文"

    This sub-clause describes PDF facilities that enable the user to navigate from page to page within a document:
    
    - Page labels for numbering or otherwise identifying individual pages (see [12.4.2], “Page Labels”).
    - Article threads, which chain together items of content within the document that are logically connected but not physically sequential (see [12.4.3], “Articles”).
    - Presentations that display the document in the form of a slide show, advancing from one page to the next either automatically or under user control (see [12.4.4], “Presentations”).

**12.4.2 Page Labels**

=== "中文"

    Each page in a PDF document shall be identified by an integer *page index* that expresses the page’s relative position within the document. In addition, a document may optionally define page labels (PDF 1.3) to identify each page visually on the screen or in print. Page labels and page indices need not coincide: the indices shall be fixed, running consecutively through the document starting from 0 for the first page, but the labels may be specified in any way that is appropriate for the particular document.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        If the document begins with 12 pages of front matter numbered in roman numerals and the remainder of the document is numbered in arabic, the first page would have a page index of 0 and a page label of i, the twelfth page would have index 11 and label xii, and the thirteenth page would have index 12 and label 1.
    
    For purposes of page labelling, a document shall be divided into labelling ranges, each of which is a series of consecutive pages using the same numbering system. Pages within a range shall be numbered sequentially in ascending order. A page’s label consists of a numeric portion based on its position within its labelling range, optionally preceded by a *label prefix denoting the range itself*.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        The pages in an appendix might be labeled with decimal numeric portions prefixed with the string A-; the resulting page labels would be A-1, A-2, and so on.
    
    A document’s labelling ranges shall be defined by the **PageLabels** entry in the document catalogue (see [7.7.2], “Document Catalog”). The value of this entry shall be a number tree ([7.9.7], “Number Trees”), each of whose keys is the page index of the first page in a labelling range. The corresponding value shall be a *page label dictionary* defining the labelling characteristics for the pages in that range. The tree shall include a value for page index 0. Table 159 shows the contents of a page label dictionary.

## 12.4.3 文章

**12.4.3 Articles**

=== "中文"

    Some types of documents may contain sequences of content items that are logically connected but not physically sequential.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE 1"
    
        A news story may begin on the first page of a newsletter and run over onto one or more nonconsecutive interior pages.
    
    To represent such sequences of physically discontiguous but logically related items, a PDF document may define one or more articles (PDF 1.1). The sequential flow of an article shall be defined by an article thread; the individual content items that make up the article are called beads on the thread. Conforming readers may provide navigation facilities to allow the user to follow a thread from one bead to the next.
    
    The optional **Threads** entry in the document catalogue (see [7.7.2], “Document Catalog”) holds an array of thread dictionaries ([Table 160](#table160)) defining the document’s articles. Each individual bead within a thread shall be represented by a bead dictionary ([Table 161](#table161)). The thread dictionary’s **F** entry shall refer to the first bead in the thread; the beads shall be chained together sequentially in a doubly linked list through their **N** (next) and **V** (previous) entries. In addition, for each page on which article beads appear, the page object (see [7.7.3], “Page Tree”) shall contain a **B** entry whose value is an array of indirect references to the beads on the page, in drawing order.

### 12.4.4.1 概述

**12.4.4.1 General**

=== "中文"

    Some conforming readers may allow a document to be displayed in the form of a presentation or slide show, advancing from one page to the next either automatically or under user control. In addition, PDF 1.5 introduces the ability to advance between different states of the same page (see [12.4.4.2], “Sub-page Navigation”).
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        PDF 1.4 introduces a different mechanism, known as alternate presentations, for slide show displays, described in [13.5], “Alternate Presentations.”
    
    A page object (see [7.7.3], “Page Tree”) may contain two optional entries, **Dur** and **Trans** (PDF 1.1), to specify how to display that page in presentation mode. The **Trans** entry shall contain a transition dictionary describing the style and duration of the visual transition to use when moving from another page to the given page during a presentation. [Table 162](#table162) shows the contents of the transition dictionary. (Some of the entries shown are needed only for certain transition styles, as indicated in the table.)
    
    The **Dur** entry in the page object specifies the page’s *display duration* (also called its advance timing): the maximum length of time, in seconds, that the page shall be displayed before the presentation automatically advances to the next page.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        The user can advance the page manually before the specified time has expired.
    
    If no **Dur** entry is specified in the page object, the page shall not advance automatically.

        Figure 56 illustrates the relationship between transition duration (**D** in the transition dictionary) and display duration (**Dur** in the page object). Note that the transition duration specified for a page (page 2 in the figure) governs the transition to that page from another page; the transition from the page is governed by the next page’s transition duration.

        The following example shows the presentation parameters for a page to be displayed for 5 seconds. Before the page is displayed, there is a 3.5-second transition in which two vertical lines sweep outward from the center to the edges of the page.

        Figure 56 illustrates the relationship between transition duration (**D** in the transition dictionary) and display duration (**Dur** in the page object). Note that the transition duration specified for a page (page 2 in the figure) governs the transition to that page from another page; the transition from the page is governed by the next page’s transition duration.

### 12.4.4.2 子页面导航

**12.4.4.2 Sub-page Navigation**

=== "中文"

    Sub-page navigation (PDF 1.5) provides the ability to navigate not only between pages but also between different states of the same page.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        A single page in a PDF presentation could have a series of bullet points that could be individually turned on and off. In such an example, the bullets would be represented by optional content (see 8.11.2, “Optional Content Groups”), and each state of the page would be represented as a navigation node.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        Conforming readers should save the state of optional content groups when a user enters presentation mode and restore it when presentation mode ends. This ensures, for example, that transient changes to bullets do not affect the printing of the document.
    
    A navigation node dictionary (see Table 163) specifies actions to execute when the user makes a navigation request.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE"
    
        Pressing an arrow key.
    
    The navigation nodes on a page form a doubly linked list by means of their Next and Prev entries. The primary node on a page shall be determined by the optional PresSteps entry in a page dictionary (see Table 30).
    
    !!! note "NOTE 3"
    
        A conforming reader should respect navigation nodes only when in presentation mode (see [12.4.4], “Presentations”).

    A conforming reader shall maintain a current navigation node. When a user navigates to a page, if the page dictionary has a **PresSteps** entry, the node specified by that entry shall become the current node. (Otherwise, there is no current node.)

            <p>The node specified by Next (if present) shall become the new current navigation node. </p>

    If the user requests to navigate to another page (regardless of whether there is a current node) and that page’s
    dictionary contains a **PresSteps** entry, the following shall occur:
    
    <ol type="a" markdown="span">
        <li>
            <p>The navigation node represented by PresSteps shall become the current node. </p>

        <li>
            <p>If the navigation request was forward, or if the navigation request was for random access (such as by clicking on a link), the actions specified by **NA** shall be executed and the node specified by Next shall become the new current node, as described previously.</p>
