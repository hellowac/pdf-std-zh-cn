**12.10 Document Requirements**

## 12.10.1 概述

**12.10.1 General**

=== "中文"

    Beginning with PDF 1.7, a document may specify requirements that shall be present in a conforming reader in order for the document to function properly. The Requirements entry in the document catalogue (see [7.7.2], “Document Catalog”) shall specify an array of requirement dictionaries, whose entries are shown in Table 264.
    
    <table id="table264" markdown="span">
        <caption>**Table 264 – Entries common to all requirement dictionaries**</caption>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>**Key**</th>
                <th>**Type**</th>
                <th>**Value**</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>**Type**</td>
                <td>name</td>
                <td>(Optional) The type of PDF object that this dictionary describes. If present, shall be **Requirement** for a requirement dictionary.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>**S**</td>
                <td>name</td>
                <td>(Required) The type of requirement that this dictionary describes. The value shall be **EnableJavaScripts**.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>**RH**</td>
                <td>array</td>
                <td>(Optional) An array of requirement handler dictionaries (see [Table 265](#table265)). This array lists the requirement handlers that shall be disabled (not executed) if the conforming reader can check the requirement specified in the **S** entry.
                </td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    
    The **RH** entry ensures backward-capability for this feature. Some PDF documents include JavaScript segments that verify compliance with certain requirements. Such JavaScript segments are called requirement handlers. Backward-compatibility shall be achieved by ensuring that either the conforming reader checks the requirement or the JavaScript segment checks the requirement, but not both.
    
    When a PDF document is first opened, all JavaScript segments in the document shall be executed, including the requirement handlers. If the conforming reader understands the requirement dictionary, it shall disable execution of the requirement handlers named by the **RH** entry. If the requirement handler is in JavaScript, the conforming reader shall look up the segment using the **Names** dictionary ([7.7.4], “Name Dictionary”).
    
    In PDF 1.7, the only defined requirement type shall be **EnableJavaScripts**. This requirement indicates that the document requires JavaScript execution to be enabled in the conforming reader. If the **EnableJavaScripts** requirement is present, an interactive conforming reader may allow the user to choose between keeping JavaScript execution disabled or temporarily enabling it to benefit from the full function of the document.
    
    If the **EnableJavaScripts** requirement is present in a requirement dictionary, the inclusion of the **RH** entry that specifies a JavaScript segment would be pointless. Writing a JavaScript segment to verify that JavaScript is enabled would not achieve the desired goal. The **RH** entry shall not be used in PDF 1.7.

**12.10.2 Requirement Handlers**

=== "中文"

    A requirement handler is a program that verifies certain requirements are satisfied. [Table 265](#table265) describes the
    entries in a requirement handler dictionary.
    
    <table id="table265" markdown="span">
        <caption>**Table 265 – Entries in a requirement handler dictionary**</caption>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>**Key**</th>
                <th>**Type**</th>
                <th>**Value**</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>**Type**</td>
                <td>name</td>
                <td>(Optional) The type of PDF object that this dictionary describes. If present, shall be **ReqHandler** for a requirement handler dictionary.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>**S**</td>
                <td>name</td>
                <td>(Required) The type of requirement handler that this dictionary describes. Valid requirement handler types shall be **JS** (for a JavaScript requirement handlers) and **NoOp**.
                    A value of **NoOp** allows older conforming readers to ignore unrecognized requirements. This value does not add any specific entry to the requirement handler dictionary.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>**Script**</td>
                <td>text string</td>
                <td>(Optional; valid only if the **S** entry has a value of **JS**) The name of a document-level JavaScript action stored in the document name dictionary (see [7.7.4], “Name Dictionary”). If the conforming reader understands the parent requirement dictionary and can verify the requirement specified in that dictionary, it shall disable execution of the requirement handler identified in this dictionary.
                </td>
            </tr>
