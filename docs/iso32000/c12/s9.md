**12.9 Measurement Properties**

=== "中文"

    PDF documents, such as those created by CAD software, may contain graphics that are intended to represent real-world objects. Users of such documents often require information about the scale and units of measurement of the corresponding real-world objects and their relationship to units in PDF user space.
    
    This information enables users of conforming readers to perform measurements that yield results in the units intended by the creator of the document. A measurement in this context is the result of a canonical function that takes as input a set of n coordinate pairs
    
    $$\left \{ (x_{_0},y_{_0}),\dots ,(x_{_{n-1}},y_{_{n-1}}) \right \}$$
    
    and produces a single number as output depending on the type of measurement. For example, distance measurement is equivalent to
    
    $$ \sum_{i=1}^{n-2}\sqrt{(x_i-x_{i+1})^2+(y_i-y_{i+1})^2}$$
    
    for $n\ge2$.
    
    Beginning with PDF 1.6, such information may be stored in a measure dictionary (see [Table 261](#table261)). Measure dictionaries provide information about measurement units associated with a rectangular area of the document known as a *viewport*.
    
    A viewport (PDF 1.6) is a rectangular region of a page. The optional **VP** entry in a page dictionary (see [Table 30](../c7/s7.md#table30)) shall specify an array of viewport dictionaries, whose entries shall be as shown in [Table 260](#table260). Viewports allow different measurement scales (specified by the **Measure** entry) to be used in different areas of a page, if necessary.
    
    The dictionaries in the **VP** array shall be in drawing order. Since viewports might overlap, to determine the viewport to use for any point on a page, the dictionaries in the array shall be examined, starting with the last one and iterating in reverse, and the first one whose **BBox** entry contains the point shall be chosen.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        Any measurement that potentially involves multiple viewports, such as one specifying the distance between two points, shall use the information specified in the viewport of the first point.

    A measure dictionary shall specify an alternate coordinate system for a region of a page. Along with the viewport dictionary, it shall provide the information needed to convert coordinates in the page’s coordinate system to coordinates in the measuring coordinate system. The measure dictionary shall provide information for formatting the resulting values into textual form for presentation in a graphical user interface.
    
    Table 261 shows the entries in a measure dictionary. PDF 1.6 defines only a single type of coordinate system, a *rectilinear* coordinate system, that shall be specified by the value **RL** for the **Subtype** entry, which is defined as one in which the x and y axes are perpendicular and have units that increment linearly (to the right and up, respectively). Other subtypes may be used, providing the flexibility to measure using other types of coordinate systems.

    Table 262 shows the additional entries in a rectilinear measure dictionary. Many of the entries in this dictionary shall be *number format arrays*, which are arrays of *number format dictionaries* (see [Table 263](#table263)). Each number format dictionary shall represent a specific unit of measurement (such as miles or feet). It shall contain information about how each unit shall be expressed in text and factors for calculating the number of units.
    
    Number format arrays specify all the units that shall be used when expressing a specific measurement. Each array shall contain one or more number format dictionaries, in descending order of granularity. If one unit of measurement X is larger than one unit of measurement Y then X has a larger order of granularity than Y. All the elements in the array shall contain text strings that, concatenated together, specify how the units shall be displayed.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        For example, a measurement of 1.4505 miles might be expressed as “1.4505 mi”, which would require one number format dictionary for miles, or as “1 mi 2,378 ft 7 5/8 in”, which would require three dictionaries (for miles, feet, and inches).
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE 1"
    
        A number format dictionary specifying feet should precede one specifying inches.

    To use a number format array to create a text string containing the appropriately formatted units for display in a user interface, apply the following algorithm:
    
    **Algorithm: Use of a number format array to create a formatted text string**
    
    a) The entry in the rectilinear measure dictionary (see [Table 262](#table262)) that references the number format array determines the meaning of the initial measurement value. For example, the **X** entry specifies user space units, and the **T** entry specifies degrees.
    
    b) Multiply the value specified previously by the **C** entry of the first number format dictionary in the array, which converts the measurement to units of the largest granularity specified in the array. Apply the value of **RT** as appropriate.
    
    c) If the result contains no nonzero fractional portion, concatenate the label specified by the **U** entry in the order specified by **O**, after adding spacing from **PS** and **SS**. The formatting is then complete.
    
    d) If there is a nonzero fractional portion and no more elements in the array, format the fractional portion as specified by the **RD**, **F**, **D**, and **FD** entries of the last dictionary. Concatenate the label specified by the **U** entry in the order specified by **O**, after adding spacing from **PS** and **SS**. The formatting is then complete.
    
    e) If there is a nonzero fractional portion and more elements in the array, proceed to the next number format dictionary in the array. Multiply its **C** entry by the fractional result from the previous step. Apply the value of **RT** as appropriate. Then proceed to step 3.
    
    The concatenation of elements in this process assumes left-to-right order. Documents using right-to-left languages may modify the process and the meaning of the entries as appropriate to produce the correct results.

        The following example shows a measure dictionary that specifies that changes in x or y are expressed in miles; distances are expressed in miles, feet, and inches; and area is expressed in acres. Given a sample distance in scaled units of 1.4505 miles, the formatted text produced by applying the number format array would be “1 mi 2,378 ft 7 5/8 in”.

    PDF documents, such as those created by CAD software, may contain graphics that are intended to represent real-world objects. Users of such documents often require information about the scale and units of measurement of the corresponding real-world objects and their relationship to units in PDF user space.
    
    This information enables users of conforming readers to perform measurements that yield results in the units intended by the creator of the document. A measurement in this context is the result of a canonical function that takes as input a set of n coordinate pairs
    
    $$\left \{ (x_{_0},y_{_0}),\dots ,(x_{_{n-1}},y_{_{n-1}}) \right \}$$
    
    and produces a single number as output depending on the type of measurement. For example, distance measurement is equivalent to
    
    $$ \sum_{i=1}^{n-2}\sqrt{(x_i-x_{i+1})^2+(y_i-y_{i+1})^2}$$
    
    for $n\ge2$.
    
    Beginning with PDF 1.6, such information may be stored in a measure dictionary (see [Table 261](#table261)). Measure dictionaries provide information about measurement units associated with a rectangular area of the document known as a *viewport*.
    
    A viewport (PDF 1.6) is a rectangular region of a page. The optional **VP** entry in a page dictionary (see [Table 30](../c7/s7.md#table30)) shall specify an array of viewport dictionaries, whose entries shall be as shown in [Table 260](#table260). Viewports allow different measurement scales (specified by the **Measure** entry) to be used in different areas of a page, if necessary.
    
    The dictionaries in the **VP** array shall be in drawing order. Since viewports might overlap, to determine the viewport to use for any point on a page, the dictionaries in the array shall be examined, starting with the last one and iterating in reverse, and the first one whose **BBox** entry contains the point shall be chosen.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        Any measurement that potentially involves multiple viewports, such as one specifying the distance between two points, shall use the information specified in the viewport of the first point.

    A measure dictionary shall specify an alternate coordinate system for a region of a page. Along with the viewport dictionary, it shall provide the information needed to convert coordinates in the page’s coordinate system to coordinates in the measuring coordinate system. The measure dictionary shall provide information for formatting the resulting values into textual form for presentation in a graphical user interface.
    
    Table 261 shows the entries in a measure dictionary. PDF 1.6 defines only a single type of coordinate system, a *rectilinear* coordinate system, that shall be specified by the value **RL** for the **Subtype** entry, which is defined as one in which the x and y axes are perpendicular and have units that increment linearly (to the right and up, respectively). Other subtypes may be used, providing the flexibility to measure using other types of coordinate systems.

    Table 262 shows the additional entries in a rectilinear measure dictionary. Many of the entries in this dictionary shall be *number format arrays*, which are arrays of *number format dictionaries* (see [Table 263](#table263)). Each number format dictionary shall represent a specific unit of measurement (such as miles or feet). It shall contain information about how each unit shall be expressed in text and factors for calculating the number of units.
    
    Number format arrays specify all the units that shall be used when expressing a specific measurement. Each array shall contain one or more number format dictionaries, in descending order of granularity. If one unit of measurement X is larger than one unit of measurement Y then X has a larger order of granularity than Y. All the elements in the array shall contain text strings that, concatenated together, specify how the units shall be displayed.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        For example, a measurement of 1.4505 miles might be expressed as “1.4505 mi”, which would require one number format dictionary for miles, or as “1 mi 2,378 ft 7 5/8 in”, which would require three dictionaries (for miles, feet, and inches).
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE 1"
    
        A number format dictionary specifying feet should precede one specifying inches.

    To use a number format array to create a text string containing the appropriately formatted units for display in a user interface, apply the following algorithm:
    
    **Algorithm: Use of a number format array to create a formatted text string**
    
    a) The entry in the rectilinear measure dictionary (see [Table 262](#table262)) that references the number format array determines the meaning of the initial measurement value. For example, the **X** entry specifies user space units, and the **T** entry specifies degrees.
    
    b) Multiply the value specified previously by the **C** entry of the first number format dictionary in the array, which converts the measurement to units of the largest granularity specified in the array. Apply the value of **RT** as appropriate.
    
    c) If the result contains no nonzero fractional portion, concatenate the label specified by the **U** entry in the order specified by **O**, after adding spacing from **PS** and **SS**. The formatting is then complete.
    
    d) If there is a nonzero fractional portion and no more elements in the array, format the fractional portion as specified by the **RD**, **F**, **D**, and **FD** entries of the last dictionary. Concatenate the label specified by the **U** entry in the order specified by **O**, after adding spacing from **PS** and **SS**. The formatting is then complete.
    
    e) If there is a nonzero fractional portion and more elements in the array, proceed to the next number format dictionary in the array. Multiply its **C** entry by the fractional result from the previous step. Apply the value of **RT** as appropriate. Then proceed to step 3.
    
    The concatenation of elements in this process assumes left-to-right order. Documents using right-to-left languages may modify the process and the meaning of the entries as appropriate to produce the correct results.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE 2"
    
        The following example shows a measure dictionary that specifies that changes in x or y are expressed in miles; distances are expressed in miles, feet, and inches; and area is expressed in acres. Given a sample distance in scaled units of 1.4505 miles, the formatted text produced by applying the number format array would be “1 mi 2,378 ft 7 5/8 in”.
    
    ```text
    <</Type /Measure
        /Subtype /RL
        /R (1in = 0.1 mi)
        /X [ <</U (mi)                    % x offset represented in miles
                /C .00139                 % Conversion from user space units to miles
                /D 100000
            ]
        /D [<< /U (mi) /C 1 >>            % Distance: initial unit is miles; no conversion needed
            << /U (ft) /C 5280 >>         % Conversion from miles to feet
            << /U (in) /C 12              % Conversion from feet to inches
               /F /F /D 8 >>              % Fractions of inches rounded to nearest 1/8
