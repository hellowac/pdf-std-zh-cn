=== "中文"

    The features described in this sub-clause allow a conforming reader to present the user with an interactive, global overview of a document in either of two forms:
    
    - As a hierarchical *outline* showing the document’s internal structure
    - As a collection of *thumbnail images* representing the pages of the document in miniature form
    
    Each item in the outline or each thumbnail image may be associated with a corresponding destination in the document, so that the user can jump directly to the destination by clicking with the mouse.

**12.3.2 Destinations**

### 12.3.2.1 概述

**12.3.2.1 General**

=== "中文"

    A destination defines a particular view of a document, consisting of the following items:
    
    - The page of the document that shall be displayed
    - The location of the document window on that page
    - The magnification (zoom) factor
    
    Destinations may be associated with outline items (see [12.3.3], “[Document Outline](#1233-文档大纲)”), annotations ([12.5.6.5], “[Link Annotations](./s5.md#12565-链接注解)”), or actions ([12.6.4.2], “[Go-To Actions](./s6.md#12642-操作指南)” and [12.6.4.3], “[Remote Go-To Actions](./s6.md#12643-远程操作)”). In each case, the destination specifies the view of the document that shall be presented when the outline item or annotation is opened or the action is performed. In addition, the optional **OpenAction** entry in a document’s catalogue ([7.7.2](../c7/s7.md#772-文档目录), “Document Catalog”) may specify a destination that shall be displayed when the document is opened. A destination may be specified either explicitly by an array of parameters defining its properties or indirectly by name.

**12.3.2.2 Explicit Destinations**

=== "中文"

    [Table 151](#table151) shows the allowed syntactic forms for specifying a destination explicitly in a PDF file. In each case, page is an indirect reference to a page object (except in a remote go-to action; see [12.6.4.3], “[Remote Go-To Actions](./s6.md#12643-远程操作)”). All coordinate values (left, right, top, and bottom) shall be expressed in the default user space coordinate system. The page’s bounding box is the smallest rectangle enclosing all of its contents. (If any side of the bounding box lies outside the page’s crop box, the corresponding side of the crop box shall be used instead; see [14.11.2], “[Page Boundaries](../c14/s11.md#14112-页面边界),” for further discussion of the crop box.)
    
    No page object can be specified for a destination associated with a remote go-to action (see [12.6.4.3], “[Remote Go-To Actions](./s6.md#12643-远程操作)”) because the destination page is in a different PDF document. In this case, the page parameter specifies an integer page number within the remote document instead of a page object in the current document.

**12.3.2.3 Named Destinations**

=== "中文"

    Instead of being defined directly with the explicit syntax shown in [Table 151](#table151), a destination may be referred to indirectly by means of a name object (PDF 1.1) or a byte string (PDF 1.2). This capability is especially useful when the destination is located in another PDF document.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        A link to the beginning of Chapter 6 in another document might refer to the destination by a name, such as Chap6 . begin, instead of by an explicit page number in the other document. Then, the location of the chapter in the other document could change without invalidating the link. If an annotation or outline item that refers to a named destination has an associated action, such as a remote go-to action (see [12.6.4.3], “Remote Go-To Actions”) or a thread action ([12.6.4.6], “Thread Actions”), the destination is in the file specified by the action’s F entry, if any; if there is no **F** entry, the destination is in the current file.
    
    In PDF 1.1, the correspondence between name objects and destinations shall be defined by the **Dests** entry in the document catalogue (see [7.7.2], “Document Catalog”). The value of this entry shall be a dictionary in which each key is a destination name and the corresponding value is either an array defining the destination, using the syntax shown in Table 151, or a dictionary with a **D** entry whose value is such an array.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        The latter form allows additional attributes to be associated with the destination, as well as enabling a go-to action (see [12.6.4.2], “Go-To Actions”) that shall be used as the target of a named destination.
    
    In PDF 1.2 and later, the correspondence between strings and destinations may alternatively be defined by the **Dests** entry in the document’s name dictionary (see [7.7.4], “Name Dictionary”). The value of this entry shall be a name tree ([7.9.6], “Name Trees”) mapping name strings to destinations. (The keys in the name tree may be treated as text strings for display purposes.) The destination value associated with a key in the name tree may be either an array or a dictionary, as described in the preceding paragraph.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 3"
    
        The use of strings as destination names is a PDF 1.2 feature. If compatibility with earlier versions of PDF is required, only name objects may be used to refer to named destinations. A document that supports PDF 1.2 can contain both types. However, if backward compatibility is not a consideration, applications should use the string form of representation in the **Dests** name tree.

## 12.3.3 文档大纲

**12.3.3 Document Outline**

=== "中文"

    A PDF document may contain a *document outline* that the conforming reader may display on the screen, allowing the user to navigate interactively from one part of the document to another. The outline consists of a tree-structured hierarchy of *outline items* (sometimes called *bookmarks*), which serve as a visual table of contents to display the document’s structure to the user. The user may interactively open and close individual items by clicking them with the mouse. When an item is open, its immediate children in the hierarchy shall become visible on the screen; each child may in turn be open or closed, selectively revealing or hiding further parts of the hierarchy. When an item is closed, all of its descendants in the hierarchy shall be hidden. Clicking the text of any visible item *activates* the item, causing the conforming reader to jump to a destination or trigger an action associated with the item.
    
    The root of a document’s outline hierarchy is an *outline dictionary* specified by the **Outlines** entry in the document catalogue (see [7.7.2], “Document Catalog”). [Table 152](#table152) shows the contents of this dictionary. Each individual outline item within the hierarchy shall be defined by an *outline item dictionary* ([Table 153](#table153)). The items at each level of the hierarchy form a linked list, chained together through their **Prev** and **Next** entries and accessed through the **First** and **Last** entries in the parent item (or in the outline dictionary in the case of top level items). When displayed on the screen, the items at a given level shall appear in the order in which they occur in the linked list.

    A PDF document may contain a *document outline* that the conforming reader may display on the screen, allowing the user to navigate interactively from one part of the document to another. The outline consists of a tree-structured hierarchy of *outline items* (sometimes called *bookmarks*), which serve as a visual table of contents to display the document’s structure to the user. The user may interactively open and close individual items by clicking them with the mouse. When an item is open, its immediate children in the hierarchy shall become visible on the screen; each child may in turn be open or closed, selectively revealing or hiding further parts of the hierarchy. When an item is closed, all of its descendants in the hierarchy shall be hidden. Clicking the text of any visible item *activates* the item, causing the conforming reader to jump to a destination or trigger an action associated with the item.
    
    The root of a document’s outline hierarchy is an *outline dictionary* specified by the **Outlines** entry in the document catalogue (see [7.7.2], “Document Catalog”). [Table 152](#table152) shows the contents of this dictionary. Each individual outline item within the hierarchy shall be defined by an *outline item dictionary* ([Table 153](#table153)). The items at each level of the hierarchy form a linked list, chained together through their **Prev** and **Next** entries and accessed through the **First** and **Last** entries in the parent item (or in the outline dictionary in the case of top level items). When displayed on the screen, the items at a given level shall appear in the order in which they occur in the linked list.

**12.3.4 Thumbnail Images**

=== "中文"

    A PDF document may contain *thumbnail images* representing the contents of its pages in miniature form. A conforming reader may display these images on the screen, allowing the user to navigate to a page by clicking its thumbnail image:
    
    !!! note NOTE
    
        Thumbnail images are not required, and may be included for some pages and not for others.
    
    The thumbnail image for a page shall be an image XObject specified by the **Thumb** entry in the page object (see [7.7.3], “Page Tree”). It has the usual structure for an image dictionary ([8.9.5], “Image Dictionaries”), but only the **Width**, **Height**, **ColorSpace**, **BitsPerComponent**, and **Decode** entries are significant; all of the other entries listed in [Table 89](../c8/s9.md#table89) shall be ignored if present. (If a **Subtype** entry is specified, its value shall be Image.) The image’s colour space shall be either **DeviceGray** or **DeviceRGB**, or an **Indexed** space based on one of these.

**12.3.5 Collections**

=== "中文"

    Beginning with PDF 1.7, PDF documents may specify how a conforming reader’s user interface presents collections of file attachments, where the attachments are related in structure or content. Such a presentation is called a portable collection.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        The intent of portable collections is to present, sort, and search collections of related documents embedded in the containing PDF document, such as email archives, photo collections, and engineering bid sets. There is no requirement that documents in a collection have an implicit relationship or even a similarity; however, showing differentiating characteristics of related documents can be helpful for document navigation.
    
    A *collection dictionary* specifies the viewing and organizational characteristics of portable collections. If this dictionary is present in a PDF document, the conforming reader shall present the document as a portable collection. The **EmbeddedFiles** name tree specifies file attachments (see [7.11.4], “Embedded File Streams”).
    
    When a conforming reader first opens a PDF document containing a collection, it shall display the contents of the initial document, along with a list of the documents present in the **EmbeddedFiles** name tree. The document list shall include the additional document information specified by the collection schema. The initial document may be the container PDF or one of the embedded documents.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        The page content in the initial document should contain information that helps the user understand what is contained in the collection, such as a title and an introductory paragraph.
    
    The file attachments comprising a collection shall be located in the **EmbeddedFiles** name tree. All attachments in that tree are in the collection; any attachments not in that tree are not.
    
    Table 155 describes the entries in a collection dictionary.

    Beginning with PDF 1.7, PDF documents may specify how a conforming reader’s user interface presents collections of file attachments, where the attachments are related in structure or content. Such a presentation is called a portable collection.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        The intent of portable collections is to present, sort, and search collections of related documents embedded in the containing PDF document, such as email archives, photo collections, and engineering bid sets. There is no requirement that documents in a collection have an implicit relationship or even a similarity; however, showing differentiating characteristics of related documents can be helpful for document navigation.
    
    A *collection dictionary* specifies the viewing and organizational characteristics of portable collections. If this dictionary is present in a PDF document, the conforming reader shall present the document as a portable collection. The **EmbeddedFiles** name tree specifies file attachments (see [7.11.4], “Embedded File Streams”).
    
    When a conforming reader first opens a PDF document containing a collection, it shall display the contents of the initial document, along with a list of the documents present in the **EmbeddedFiles** name tree. The document list shall include the additional document information specified by the collection schema. The initial document may be the container PDF or one of the embedded documents.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        The page content in the initial document should contain information that helps the user understand what is contained in the collection, such as a title and an introductory paragraph.
    
    The file attachments comprising a collection shall be located in the **EmbeddedFiles** name tree. All attachments in that tree are in the collection; any attachments not in that tree are not.
    
    Table 155 describes the entries in a collection dictionary.

    A *collection sort dictionary* identifies the fields that shall be used to sort items in the collection. The type of sorting depends on the type of data:
    
    - Text strings shall be ordered lexically from smaller to larger, if ascending order is specified.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 3"
    
        Lexical ordering is an implementation dependency for conforming readers.
    
    - Numbers shall be ordered numerically from smaller to larger, if ascending order is specified.
    - Dates shall be ordered from oldest to newest, if ascending order is specified.
    
    Table 158 describes the entries in a collection sort dictionary.

                <td>(Required) The name or names of fields that the conforming reader shall use to sort the items in the collection. If the value is a name, it identifies a field described in the parent collection dictionary. <br/> If the value is an array, each element of the array shall be a name that identifies a field described in the parent collection dictionary. The array form shall be used to allow additional fields to contribute to the sort, where each additional field shall be used to break ties. More specifically, if multiple collection item dictionaries have the same value for the first field named in the array, the values for successive fields named in the array shall be used for sorting, until a unique order is determined or until the named fields are exhausted.</td>

If the value is an array, each element of the array shall be a boolean value that specifies whether the entry at the same index in the **S** array shall be sorted in ascending or descending order. <br/> 
                If the number of entries in the **A** array is larger than the number of entries in the **S** array the extra entries in the **A** array shall be ignored. If the number of entries in the **A** array is less than the number of entries in the **S** array the missing entries in the **A** array shall be assumed to be **true**. <br/>
                Default value: **true**.</td>

        This example shows a collection dictionary representing an email in-box, where each item in the collection is an email message. The actual email messages are contained in file specification dictionaries. The organizational data associated with each email is described in a collection schema dictionary. Most actual organizational data (from, to, date, and subject) is provided in a collection item dictionary, but the size data comes from the embedded file parameter dictionary.
    
        ```text
        /Collection <<
          /Type /Collection
            /Schema <<
            /Type /CollectionSchema
            /from << /Subtype /S /N (From) /O 1 /V true /E false>>
            /to << /Subtype /S /N (To) /O 2 /V true /E false >>
            /date << /Subtype /D /N (Date received) /O 3 /V true /E false >>
            /subject << /Subtype /S /N (Subject) /O 4 /V true /E false >>
            /size << /Subtype /Size /N (Size) /O 5 /V true /E false >>
            >>
          /D (Doc1)

    !!! info "EXAMPLE 2"
    
        This example shows a collection item dictionary and a collection subitem dictionary. These dictionaries contain entries that correspond to the schema entries specified in the Example in [12.4.2], “Page Labels.”. [7.11.6], “Collection Items” specifies the collection item and collection subitem dictionaries.
    
        ```text
        /CI <<
            /Type /CollectionItem
            /from (Rob McAfee)
            /to (Patty McAfee)
            /subject <<
                /Type /CollectionSubitem
                /P (Re:)
                /D (Let's have lunch on Friday!)
            >>
            /date (D:20050621094703-07’00’)
        >>
