# 12.1 概述

**12.1 General**

=== "中文"

    For purposes of the trigger events **E** (enter), **X** (exit), **D** (down), and **U** (up), the term *mouse* denotes a generic pointing device with the following characteristics:
    
    - A selection button that can be *pressed*, *held down*, and *released*. If there is more than one mouse button, the selection button is typically the left button.
    - A notion of *location—that* is, an indication of where on the screen the device is pointing. Location is typically denoted by a screen cursor.
    - A notion of *focus*—that is, which element in the document is currently interacting with the with the user. In many systems, this element is denoted by a blinking caret, a focus rectangle, or a colour change.
    
    This clause describes the PDF features that allow a user to interact with a document on the screen, using the mouse and keyboard (with the exception of multimedia features, which are described in [13], “[Multimedia Features](../c13/index.md#13-多媒体功能)”):
    
    - *Preference settings* to control the way the document is presented on the screen ([12.2], “[Viewer Preferences](../c12/s2.md#122-查看器首选项)”)
    - *Navigation* facilities for moving through the document in a variety of ways (Sections [12.3], “[Document-Level Navigation](../c12/s3.md#123-文档级导航)” and [12.4], “[Page-Level Navigation](../c12/s4.md#124-页面级导航)”)
    - *Annotations* for adding text notes, sounds, movies, and other ancillary information to the document ([12.5], “[Annotations](../c12/s5.md#125-注解)”)
    - *Actions* that can be triggered by specified events ([12.6], “[Actions](../c12/s6.md#126-行为)”)
    - *Interactive forms* for gathering information from the user ([12.7], “[Interactive Forms](../c12/s7.md#127-交互式表格)”)
    - *Digital signatures* that authenticate the identity of a user and the validity of the document’s contents ([12.8], “[Digital Signatures](../c12/s8.md#128-数字签名)”)
    - *Measurement properties* that enable the display of real-world units corresponding to objects on a page ([12.9], “[Measurement Properties](../c12/s9.md#129-测量属性)”)
