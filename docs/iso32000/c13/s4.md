    The features described in this sub-clause are obsolescent and their use is no longer recommended. They are superseded by the general multimedia framework described in [13.2], “Multimedia.”
    
    PDF shall embed movies within a document by means of movie annotations (see [12.5.6.17], “Movie Annotations”). Despite the name, a movie may consist entirely of sound with no visible images to be displayed on the screen. The **Movie** and **A** (activation) entries in the movie annotation dictionary shall refer, respectively, to a *movie dictionary* ([Table 295](#table295)) that shall describe the static characteristics of the movie and a *movie activation dictionary* ([Table 296](#table296)) that shall specify how it shall be presented.
