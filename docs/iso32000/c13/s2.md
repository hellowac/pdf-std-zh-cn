=== "中文"

    PDF 1.5 introduces a comprehensive set of language constructs to enable the following capabilities:
    
    - Arbitrary media types may be embedded in PDF files.
    - Embedded media, as well as referenced media outside a PDF file, may be played with a variety of player software. (In some situations, the player software may be the conforming reader itself.)
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        The term playing is used with a wide variety of media, and is not restricted to audio or video. For example, it may be applied to static images such as JPEGs.
    
    - Media objects may have multiple renditions, which may be chosen at play-time based on considerations such as available bandwidth.
    - Document authors may control play-time requirements, such as which player software should be used to play a given media object.
    - Media objects may be played in various ways; for example, in a floating window as well as in a region on a page.
    - Future extensions to the media constructs may be handled in an appropriate manner by current conforming readers. Authors may control how old conforming readers treat future extensions.
    - Document authors may adapt the use of multimedia to accessibility requirements.
    - On-line media objects may be played efficiently, even when very large.
    
    The following list summarizes the multimedia features and indicates where each feature is discussed:
    
    - [13.2.2], “Viability,” describes the rules for determining when media objects are suitable for playing on a particular system.
    - Rendition actions (see [12.6.4.13], “Rendition Actions”) shall be used to begin the playing of multimedia content.
    - A rendition action associates a screen annotation (see [12.5.6.18], “Screen Annotations”) with a rendition (see [13.2.3], “Renditions”).
    - Renditions are of two varieties: media renditions (see [13.2.3.2], “Media Renditions”) that define the characteristics of the media to be played, and selector renditions (see [13.2.3.3], “Selector Renditions”) that enables choosing which of a set of media renditions should be played.
    - Media renditions contain entries that specify what should be played (see [13.2.4], “Media Clip Objects”), how it should be played (see [13.2.5], “Media Play Parameters”), and where it should be played (see [13.2.6], “Media Screen Parameters”).
    - [13.2.7], “Other Multimedia Objects,” describes several PDF objects that are referenced by the preceding major objects.

## 13.2.2 可行性

**13.2.2 Viability**

=== "中文"

    When playing multimedia content, the conforming reader shall often make decisions such as which player software and which options, such as volume and duration, to use.
    
    In making these decisions, the viewer shall determine the *viability* of the objects used. If an object is considered non-viable, the media should not be played. If the object is viable, the media should be played, though possibly under less than optimum conditions.
    
    There are several entries in the multimedia object dictionaries whose values shall have an effect on viability. In particular, some of the object dictionaries define two entries that divide options into one of two categories:
    
    - **MH** (“must honour”): The options specified by this entry shall be honoured; otherwise, the containing object shall be considered non-viable.
    - **BE** (“best effort”): An attempt should be made to honour the options; however, if they cannot be honoured, the containing object is still considered viable.
    
    **MH** and **BE** are both dictionaries, and the same entries shall be defined for both of them. In any dictionary
    where these entries are allowed, both entries may be present, or only one, or neither.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE"
    
        The media play parameters dictionary (see [Table 279](#table279)) allows the playback volume to be set by means of the **V** entry in its **MH** and **BE** dictionaries (see [Table 280](#table280)).
    
    If the specified volume cannot be honoured, the object shall be considered non-viable if **V** is in the **MH** dictionary, and playback shall not occur. If **V** is in the **BE** dictionary (and not also in the **MH** dictionary), playback should still occur: the playing software attempts to honour the specified option as best it can.
    
    Using this mechanism, authors may specify minimum requirements (**MH**) and preferred options (**BE**). They may also specify how entries that are added in the future to the multimedia dictionaries shall be interpreted by old conforming readers. If an entry that is unrecognized by the viewer is in the **MH** dictionary, the object shall be considered non-viable. If an unrecognized entry is in a **BE** dictionary, the entry shall be ignored and viability shall be unaffected. Unless otherwise stated, an object shall be considered non-viable if its **MH** dictionary contains an unrecognized key or an unrecognized value for a recognized key.
    
    The following rules apply to the entries in **MH** and **BE** dictionaries, which behave somewhat differently from other PDF dictionaries:
    
    - If an entry is required, the requirement is met if the entry is present in either the **MH** dictionary or the **BE** dictionary.
    - If an optional entry is not present in either dictionary, it shall be considered to be present with its default value (if one is defined) in the **BE** dictionary.
    - If an instance of the same entry is present in both **MH** and **BE**, the instance in the **BE** dictionary shall be ignored unless otherwise specified.
    - If the value of an entry in an **MH** or a **BE** dictionary is a dictionary or array, it shall be treated as an atomic unit when determining viability. That is, all entries within the dictionary or array shall be honoured for the containing object to be viable.
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
    When determining whether entries can be honoured, it is not required that each one be evaluated independently, since they may be dependent on one another. That is, a conforming reader or player may examine multiple entries at once (even within different dictionaries) to determine whether their values can be honoured.
    
    The following media objects may have **MH** and **BE** dictionaries. They function as described previously, except where noted in the individual sub-clauses:
    
    - Rendition ([Table 267](#table267))
    - Media clip data ([Table 276](#table276))
    - Media clip section ([Table 278](#table278))
    - Media play parameters ([Table 280](#table280))
    - Media screen parameters ([Table 283](#table283))

## 13.2.3 演绎版

**13.2.3 Renditions**

### 13.2.3.1 概述

**13.2.3.1 General**

=== "中文"

    There are two types of *rendition* objects:
    
    - A media rendition (see [13.2.3.2], “Media Renditions”) is a basic media object that specifies what to play, how to play it, and where to play it.
    - A selector rendition (see [13.2.3.3], “Selector Renditions”) contains an ordered list of renditions. This list may include other selector renditions, resulting in a tree whose leaves are media renditions. The conforming reader should play the first viable media rendition it encounters in the tree (see [13.2.2], “Viability”).
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        [Table 266](#table266) shows the entries common to all rendition dictionaries. The N entry in a rendition dictionary specifies a name that can be used to access the rendition object by means of name tree lookup (see [Table 31](../c7/s7.md#table31)). JavaScript actions (see [12.6.4.16], “JavaScript Actions”), for example, use this mechanism. Since the values referenced by name trees shall be indirect objects, all rendition objects should be indirect objects.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        A rendition dictionary is not required to have a name tree entry. When it does, the conforming reader should ensure that the name specified in the tree is kept the same as the value of the N entry (for example, if the user interface allows the name to be changed). A document should not contain multiple renditions with the same name.
    
    The **MH** and **BE** entries are dictionaries whose entries may be present in one or the other of them, as described in [13.2.2], “Viability.” For renditions, these dictionaries shall have a single entry C (see [Table 267](#table267)), whose value shall have a media criteria dictionary specifying a set of criteria that shall be met for the rendition to be considered viable (see [Table 268](#table268)).
    
    The media criteria dictionary behaves somewhat differently than other **MH/BE** entries, as they are described in [13.2.2], “Viability.” The criteria specified by all of its entries shall be met regardless of whether they are in an **MH** or a **BE** dictionary. The only exception is that if an entry in a **BE** dictionary is unrecognized by the conforming reader, it shall not affect the viability of the object. If a media criteria dictionary is present in both **MH** and **BE**, the entries in both dictionaries shall be individually evaluated, with MH taking precedence (corresponding **BE** entries shall be ignored).

    There are two types of *rendition* objects:
    
    - A media rendition (see [13.2.3.2], “Media Renditions”) is a basic media object that specifies what to play, how to play it, and where to play it.
    - A selector rendition (see [13.2.3.3], “Selector Renditions”) contains an ordered list of renditions. This list may include other selector renditions, resulting in a tree whose leaves are media renditions. The conforming reader should play the first viable media rendition it encounters in the tree (see [13.2.2], “Viability”).
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        [Table 266](#table266) shows the entries common to all rendition dictionaries. The N entry in a rendition dictionary specifies a name that can be used to access the rendition object by means of name tree lookup (see [Table 31](../c7/s7.md#table31)). JavaScript actions (see [12.6.4.16], “JavaScript Actions”), for example, use this mechanism. Since the values referenced by name trees shall be indirect objects, all rendition objects should be indirect objects.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        A rendition dictionary is not required to have a name tree entry. When it does, the conforming reader should ensure that the name specified in the tree is kept the same as the value of the N entry (for example, if the user interface allows the name to be changed). A document should not contain multiple renditions with the same name.
    
    The **MH** and **BE** entries are dictionaries whose entries may be present in one or the other of them, as described in [13.2.2], “Viability.” For renditions, these dictionaries shall have a single entry C (see [Table 267](#table267)), whose value shall have a media criteria dictionary specifying a set of criteria that shall be met for the rendition to be considered viable (see [Table 268](#table268)).
    
    The media criteria dictionary behaves somewhat differently than other **MH/BE** entries, as they are described in [13.2.2], “Viability.” The criteria specified by all of its entries shall be met regardless of whether they are in an **MH** or a **BE** dictionary. The only exception is that if an entry in a **BE** dictionary is unrecognized by the conforming reader, it shall not affect the viability of the object. If a media criteria dictionary is present in both **MH** and **BE**, the entries in both dictionaries shall be individually evaluated, with MH taking precedence (corresponding **BE** entries shall be ignored).

**13.2.3.3 Selector Renditions**

=== "中文"

    A *selector rendition dictionary* shall specify an array of rendition objects in its **R** entry (see [Table 272](#table272)). The renditions in this array should be ordered by preference, with the most preferred rendition first. At play-time, the renditions in the array shall be evaluated and the first viable media rendition, if any, shall be played. If one of the renditions is itself a selector, that selector shall be evaluated in turn, yielding the equivalent of a depth-first tree search. A selector rendition itself may be non-viable; in this case, none of its associated media renditions shall be evaluated (in effect, this branch of the tree is skipped).
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
        This mechanism may be used, for example, to specify that a large video clip should be used on high-bandwidth machines and a smaller clip should be used on low-bandwidth machines.

    The media clip data object shall be considered non-viable if the object referenced by the **D** entry does not contain a **Type** entry, the **Type** entry is unrecognized, or the referenced object is not a dictionary or stream.
    
    This shall effectively exclude the use of simple file specifications (see [7.11], “File Specifications”).
    
    If **D** references a file specification that has an embedded file stream (see [7.11.4], “Embedded File Streams”), the embedded file stream’s **Subtype** entry shall be ignored if present, and the media clip data dictionary’s **CT** entry shall identify the type of data.
    
    If **D** references a form XObject, the associated player is implicitly the conforming reader, and the form XObject
    shall be rendered as if it were any other data type.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        The **F** and **D** entries in the media play parameters dictionary (see [Table 279](#table279)) should apply to a form XObject just as they do to a QuickTime movie.
    
    For media other than form XObjects, the media clip object shall provide enough information to allow a conforming reader to locate an appropriate player. This may be done by providing one or both of the following entries, the first being the preferred method:
    
    - A **CT** entry that specifies the content type of the media. If this entry is present, any player that is selected shall support this content type.
    - A **PL** entry that specifies one or more players that may be used to play the referenced media. if **CT** is present, there should also be a **PL** present.
    
    The **P** entry specifies a *media permissions dictionary* (see [Table 275](#table275)) specifying the manner in which the data referenced by the media may be used by a conforming reader. These permissions allow authors control over how their data is exposed to operations that could allow it to be copied. If the dictionary contains unrecognized entries or entries with unrecognized values, it shall be considered non-viable, and the conforming reader shall not play the media.

                    (TEMPACCESS) Allowed only if the document permissions allow content extraction, including for accessibility purposes; when bits 5 or 10 of the user access permissions (see [Table 22](../c7/s6.md#table22)) are set, or both. <br/>

    The **BU** entry in the media clip data **MH** and **BE** dictionaries (see [Table 276](#table276)) specifies a base URL for the media data. Relative URLs in the media (which point to auxiliary files or are used for hyperlinking) should be resolved with respect to the value of **BU**. The following are additional requirements concerning the **BU** entry:
    
    - If **BU** is in the **MH** dictionary and the base URL is not honoured the media clip data shall be non-viable.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 3"
    
        An example of this is that the player does not accept base URLs.
    
    - Determining the viability of the object shall not require checking whether the base URL is valid
    
    !!! note "NOTE 4"
    
        The target host exists.
    
    - Absolute URls within the media shall not be affected.
    - If the media itself contains a base URL, that value shall be used in preference to **BU**.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 5"
    
        An example of this is that the &lt;BASE&gt; element is defined in HTML.
    
    - BU is completely independent of and unrelated to the value of the URI entry in the document catalogu (see [7.7.2], “Document Catalog”).
    - If BU is not present and the media is embedded within the document, the URL to the PDF file itself shall be used as if it were the value of a BU entry in the BE dictionary; that is, as an implicit best-effort base URL.

    The media clip data object shall be considered non-viable if the object referenced by the **D** entry does not contain a **Type** entry, the **Type** entry is unrecognized, or the referenced object is not a dictionary or stream.
    
    This shall effectively exclude the use of simple file specifications (see [7.11], “File Specifications”).
    
    If **D** references a file specification that has an embedded file stream (see [7.11.4], “Embedded File Streams”), the embedded file stream’s **Subtype** entry shall be ignored if present, and the media clip data dictionary’s **CT** entry shall identify the type of data.
    
    If **D** references a form XObject, the associated player is implicitly the conforming reader, and the form XObject
    shall be rendered as if it were any other data type.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        The **F** and **D** entries in the media play parameters dictionary (see [Table 279](#table279)) should apply to a form XObject just as they do to a QuickTime movie.
    
    For media other than form XObjects, the media clip object shall provide enough information to allow a conforming reader to locate an appropriate player. This may be done by providing one or both of the following entries, the first being the preferred method:
    
    - A **CT** entry that specifies the content type of the media. If this entry is present, any player that is selected shall support this content type.
    - A **PL** entry that specifies one or more players that may be used to play the referenced media. if **CT** is present, there should also be a **PL** present.
    
    The **P** entry specifies a *media permissions dictionary* (see [Table 275](#table275)) specifying the manner in which the data referenced by the media may be used by a conforming reader. These permissions allow authors control over how their data is exposed to operations that could allow it to be copied. If the dictionary contains unrecognized entries or entries with unrecognized values, it shall be considered non-viable, and the conforming reader shall not play the media.

    The **BU** entry in the media clip data **MH** and **BE** dictionaries (see [Table 276](#table276)) specifies a base URL for the media data. Relative URLs in the media (which point to auxiliary files or are used for hyperlinking) should be resolved with respect to the value of **BU**. The following are additional requirements concerning the **BU** entry:
    
    - If **BU** is in the **MH** dictionary and the base URL is not honoured the media clip data shall be non-viable.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 3"
    
        An example of this is that the player does not accept base URLs.
    
    - Determining the viability of the object shall not require checking whether the base URL is valid
    
    !!! note "NOTE 4"
    
        The target host exists.
    
    - Absolute URls within the media shall not be affected.
    - If the media itself contains a base URL, that value shall be used in preference to **BU**.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 5"
    
        An example of this is that the &lt;BASE&gt; element is defined in HTML.
    
    - BU is completely independent of and unrelated to the value of the URI entry in the document catalogu (see [7.7.2], “Document Catalog”).
    - If BU is not present and the media is embedded within the document, the URL to the PDF file itself shall be used as if it were the value of a BU entry in the BE dictionary; that is, as an implicit best-effort base URL.

### 13.2.4.3 媒体剪辑部分

**13.2.4.3 Media Clip Section**

=== "中文"

    A *media clip section* dictionary (see [Table 277](#table277)) defines a continuous section of another media clip object (known as the *next-level* media clip object). The next-level media clip object, specified by the **D** entry, may be either a media clip data object or another media clip section object. However, the linked list formed by the **D** entries of media clip sections shall terminate in a media clip data object. If the next-level media object is non- viable, the media clip section shall be also non-viable.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        A media clip section could define a 15-minute segment of a media clip data object representing a two-hour movie.

    - When **B** or **E** are specified by markers, there shall be a corresponding absolute offset into the underlying media clip data object. If this offset is not within the range defined by the next-level media clip (if any), or if the marker is not present in the underlying media clip, the existence of the entry shall be ignored, and there is no effect on viability.
    - If the absolute offset derived from the values of all **B** entries in a media clip section chain is greater than or equal to the absolute offset derived from the values of all **E** entries, an empty range shall be defined. An empty range is legal.
    - Any **B** or **E** entry in a media clip section’s **MH** dictionary shall be honoured at play-time in order for the media clip section to be considered viable.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        The entry may not be honored if its value was not viable or if the player did not support its value; for example, the player did not support markers.
    
    - If a **B** or **E** entry is in a media clip section’s **MH** dictionary, all **B** or **E** entries, respectively, at deeper levels (closer to the media clip data), shall be evaluated as if they were in an **MH** dictionary (even if they are actually within **BE** dictionaries).

    The value of the D entry is a media duration dictionary, whose entries are shown in Table 281. It specifies a temporal duration.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        The D entry dictionary temporal duration corresponds to the notion of a simple duration in SMIL.
    
    The duration may be a specific amount of time, it may be infinity, or it may be the media’s intrinsic duration.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE"
    
        The intrinsic duration of a two-hour QuickTime movie is two hours.
    
    The intrinsic duration may be modified when a media clip section (see [13.2.4.3], “Media Clip Section”) is used: the intrinsic duration shall be the difference between the absolute begin and end offsets. For a media type having no notion of time (such as a JPEG image), the duration shall be considered to be infinity.
    
    If the simple duration is longer than the intrinsic duration, the player shall freeze the media in its final state until the simple duration has elapsed. For visual media types, the last appearance (frame) shall be displayed. For aural media types, the media is logically frozen but shall not continue to produce sound.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        In this case, the **RC** entry, which specifies a repeat count, applies to the simple duration; therefore, the entire play-pause sequence is repeated **RC** times.

## 13.2.6 媒体屏幕参数

**13.2.6 Media Screen Parameters**

### 13.2.6.1 概述

**13.2.6.1 General**

=== "中文"

    A media screen parameters dictionary (see Table 282) shall specify where a media object should be played. It shall contain **MH** and **BE** dictionaries (see Table 283), which shall function as discussed in [13.2.2], “Viability.” All media clips that are being played shall be associated with a particular document and shall be stopped when the document is closed.
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
        Conforming readers should disallow floating windows and full-screen windows unless specifically allowed by the user. The reason is that document-based security attacks are possible if windows containing arbitrary media content can be displayed without indicating to the user that the window is merely hosting a media object. This recommendation may be relaxed if it is possible to communicate the nature of such windows to the user; for example, with text in a floating window’s title bar.

=== "英文"

    A media screen parameters dictionary (see Table 282) shall specify where a media object should be played. It shall contain **MH** and **BE** dictionaries (see Table 283), which shall function as discussed in [13.2.2], “Viability.” All media clips that are being played shall be associated with a particular document and shall be stopped when the document is closed.
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
        Conforming readers should disallow floating windows and full-screen windows unless specifically allowed by the user. The reason is that document-based security attacks are possible if windows containing arbitrary media content can be displayed without indicating to the user that the window is merely hosting a media object. This recommendation may be relaxed if it is possible to communicate the nature of such windows to the user; for example, with text in a floating window’s title bar.

        **MU** could contain a media player info dictionary describing versions 1 to 10 of Player X and another describing versions 3 through 5 of Player X.
    
    If a non-viable media player info dictionary is referenced by **MU**, **NU**, or **A**, it shall be treated as if it were not present in its original array, and a media player info dictionary containing the same software identifier dictionary (see [13.2.7.4], “Software Identifier Dictionary”) shall logically considered present in **NU**. The same rule shall apply to a media player info dictionary that contains a partially unrecognized software identifier dictionary.
    
    Since both media clip data and media play parameters dictionaries may be employed in a play operation, and each may reference a media players dictionary, there is a potential for conflict between the contents of the two media players dictionaries. At play-time, the viewer shall use the following algorithm to determine whether a player present on the machine may be employed. The player may not be used if any of the following conditions are true:
    
    **Algorithm: Media Player**
    
    a) The content type is known and the player does not support the type.
    b) The player is found in the **NU** array of either dictionary.
    c) Both dictionaries have non-empty **MU** arrays and the player is not found in both of them, or only one of the dictionaries has a non-empty **MU** array and the player is not found in it.
    d) Neither dictionary has a non-empty **MU** array, the content type is not known, and the player is not found in the **A** array of either dictionary.
    
    If none of the conditions are true, the player may be used.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        A player is “found” in the **NU**, **MU**, or **A** arrays if it matches the information found in the PID entry of one of the entries, as described by the Algorithm in [13.2.7.4], “Software Identifier Dictionary.”

    If a non-viable media player info dictionary is referenced by **MU**, **NU**, or **A**, it shall be treated as if it were not present in its original array, and a media player info dictionary containing the same software identifier dictionary (see [13.2.7.4], “Software Identifier Dictionary”) shall logically considered present in **NU**. The same rule shall apply to a media player info dictionary that contains a partially unrecognized software identifier dictionary.
    
    Since both media clip data and media play parameters dictionaries may be employed in a play operation, and each may reference a media players dictionary, there is a potential for conflict between the contents of the two media players dictionaries. At play-time, the viewer shall use the following algorithm to determine whether a player present on the machine may be employed. The player may not be used if any of the following conditions are true:
    
    **Algorithm: Media Player**
    
    a) The content type is known and the player does not support the type.
    b) The player is found in the **NU** array of either dictionary.
    c) Both dictionaries have non-empty **MU** arrays and the player is not found in both of them, or only one of the dictionaries has a non-empty **MU** array and the player is not found in it.
    d) Neither dictionary has a non-empty **MU** array, the content type is not known, and the player is not found in the **A** array of either dictionary.
    
    If none of the conditions are true, the player may be used.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        A player is “found” in the **NU**, **MU**, or **A** arrays if it matches the information found in the PID entry of one of the entries, as described by the Algorithm in [13.2.7.4], “Software Identifier Dictionary.”

=== "中文"

    A *software identifier dictionary* shall allow software to be identified by name, range of versions, and operating systems; its entries are listed in [Table 292](#table292). A conforming reader uses this information to determine whether a given media player may be used in a given situation. If the dictionary contains keys that are unrecognized by the conforming reader, it shall be considered to be partially recognized. The conforming reader may or may not decide to treat the software identifier as viable, depending on the context in which it is used.
    
    The following procedure shall be used to determine whether a piece of software is considered to match a software identifier dictionary:
    
    **Algorithm: Software identifier**
    
    a)The software name shall match the name specified by the **U** entry (see “[Software URIs](#132742-软件-uri)” in [13.2.7.4], “Software Identifier Dictionary”).

    where software_name shall be reg_name as defined in Internet RFC 2396, *Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax*; see the [Bibliography](../bibliography.md). software_name shall be a sequence of UTF-8-encoded characters that have been escaped with one pass of URL escaping (see [14.10.3.2], “URL Strings”). That is, to recover the original software name, software_name shall be unescaped and then treated as a sequence of UTF-8 characters. The actual software names shall be compared in a case-sensitive fashion.
    
    Software names shall be second-class names (see [Annex E](../a5.md)).

**13.2.7.4.3 Version arrays**

=== "中文"

    The **L**, **H**, **LI**, and **HI** entries shall be used to specify a range of software versions. **L** and H shall be version arrays containing zero or more non-negative integers representing subversion numbers. The first integer shall be the major version numbers, and subsequent integers shall be increasingly minor. **H** shall be greater than or equal to **L**, according to the following rules for comparing version arrays:
    
    **Algorithm: Comparing version arrays**
    
    a) An empty version array shall be treated as infinity; that is, it shall be considered greater than any other version array except another empty array. Two empty arrays are equal.
    
    b) When comparing arrays that contain different numbers of elements, the smaller array shall be implicitly padded with zero-valued integers to make the number of elements equal.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE"
    
        When comparing [5 1 2 3 4] to [5], the latter is treated as [5 0 0 0 0].
    
    c) The corresponding elements of the arrays shall be compared, starting with the first. When a difference is found, the array containing the larger element shall be considered to have the larger version number. If no differences are found, the versions are equal.
    
    If a version array contains negative numbers, it shall be considered non-viable, as is the enclosing software identifier.

    A *monitor specifier* is an integer that shall identify a physical monitor attached to a system. It may have one of the values in Table 293:
        
    <table id="table293" markdown="span">
        <caption>**Table 293 – Monitor specifier values**</caption>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>**Value**</th>
                <th>**Description**</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>0</td> <td>The monitor containing the largest section of the document window</td></tr>
            <tr><td>1</td> <td>The monitor containing the smallest section of the document window</td></tr>
            <tr><td>2</td> <td>Primary monitor. If no monitor is considered primary, shall treat as case 0</td></tr>
            <tr><td>3</td> <td>Monitor with the greatest colour depth</td></tr>
            <tr><td>4</td> <td>Monitor with the greatest area (in pixels squared)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>5</td> <td>Monitor with the greatest height (in pixels)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>6</td> <td>Monitor with the greatest width (in pixels)</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    
    For some of these values, it is possible have a “tie” at play-time; for example, two monitors might have the same colour depth. Ties may be broken in an implementation-dependent manner.
