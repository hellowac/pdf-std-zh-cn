=== "中文"

    PDF 1.5 introduces a comprehensive set of language constructs to enable the following capabilities:
    
    - Arbitrary media types may be embedded in PDF files.
    - Embedded media, as well as referenced media outside a PDF file, may be played with a variety of player software. (In some situations, the player software may be the conforming reader itself.)
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        The term playing is used with a wide variety of media, and is not restricted to audio or video. For example, it may be applied to static images such as JPEGs.
    
    - Media objects may have multiple renditions, which may be chosen at play-time based on considerations such as available bandwidth.
    - Document authors may control play-time requirements, such as which player software should be used to play a given media object.
    - Media objects may be played in various ways; for example, in a floating window as well as in a region on a page.
    - Future extensions to the media constructs may be handled in an appropriate manner by current conforming readers. Authors may control how old conforming readers treat future extensions.
    - Document authors may adapt the use of multimedia to accessibility requirements.
    - On-line media objects may be played efficiently, even when very large.
    
    The following list summarizes the multimedia features and indicates where each feature is discussed:
    
    - [13.2.2], “Viability,” describes the rules for determining when media objects are suitable for playing on a particular system.
    - Rendition actions (see [12.6.4.13], “Rendition Actions”) shall be used to begin the playing of multimedia content.
    - A rendition action associates a screen annotation (see [12.5.6.18], “Screen Annotations”) with a rendition (see [13.2.3], “Renditions”).
    - Renditions are of two varieties: media renditions (see [13.2.3.2], “Media Renditions”) that define the characteristics of the media to be played, and selector renditions (see [13.2.3.3], “Selector Renditions”) that enables choosing which of a set of media renditions should be played.
    - Media renditions contain entries that specify what should be played (see [13.2.4], “Media Clip Objects”), how it should be played (see [13.2.5], “Media Play Parameters”), and where it should be played (see [13.2.6], “Media Screen Parameters”).
    - [13.2.7], “Other Multimedia Objects,” describes several PDF objects that are referenced by the preceding major objects.

## 13.2.2 可行性

**13.2.2 Viability**

=== "中文"

    When playing multimedia content, the conforming reader shall often make decisions such as which player software and which options, such as volume and duration, to use.
    
    In making these decisions, the viewer shall determine the *viability* of the objects used. If an object is considered non-viable, the media should not be played. If the object is viable, the media should be played, though possibly under less than optimum conditions.
    
    There are several entries in the multimedia object dictionaries whose values shall have an effect on viability. In particular, some of the object dictionaries define two entries that divide options into one of two categories:
    
    - **MH** (“must honour”): The options specified by this entry shall be honoured; otherwise, the containing object shall be considered non-viable.
    - **BE** (“best effort”): An attempt should be made to honour the options; however, if they cannot be honoured, the containing object is still considered viable.
    
    **MH** and **BE** are both dictionaries, and the same entries shall be defined for both of them. In any dictionary
    where these entries are allowed, both entries may be present, or only one, or neither.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE"
    
        The media play parameters dictionary (see [Table 279](#table279)) allows the playback volume to be set by means of the **V** entry in its **MH** and **BE** dictionaries (see [Table 280](#table280)).
    
    If the specified volume cannot be honoured, the object shall be considered non-viable if **V** is in the **MH** dictionary, and playback shall not occur. If **V** is in the **BE** dictionary (and not also in the **MH** dictionary), playback should still occur: the playing software attempts to honour the specified option as best it can.
    
    Using this mechanism, authors may specify minimum requirements (**MH**) and preferred options (**BE**). They may also specify how entries that are added in the future to the multimedia dictionaries shall be interpreted by old conforming readers. If an entry that is unrecognized by the viewer is in the **MH** dictionary, the object shall be considered non-viable. If an unrecognized entry is in a **BE** dictionary, the entry shall be ignored and viability shall be unaffected. Unless otherwise stated, an object shall be considered non-viable if its **MH** dictionary contains an unrecognized key or an unrecognized value for a recognized key.
    
    The following rules apply to the entries in **MH** and **BE** dictionaries, which behave somewhat differently from other PDF dictionaries:
    
    - If an entry is required, the requirement is met if the entry is present in either the **MH** dictionary or the **BE** dictionary.
    - If an optional entry is not present in either dictionary, it shall be considered to be present with its default value (if one is defined) in the **BE** dictionary.
    - If an instance of the same entry is present in both **MH** and **BE**, the instance in the **BE** dictionary shall be ignored unless otherwise specified.
    - If the value of an entry in an **MH** or a **BE** dictionary is a dictionary or array, it shall be treated as an atomic unit when determining viability. That is, all entries within the dictionary or array shall be honoured for the containing object to be viable.
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
    When determining whether entries can be honoured, it is not required that each one be evaluated independently, since they may be dependent on one another. That is, a conforming reader or player may examine multiple entries at once (even within different dictionaries) to determine whether their values can be honoured.
    
    The following media objects may have **MH** and **BE** dictionaries. They function as described previously, except where noted in the individual sub-clauses:
    
    - Rendition ([Table 267](#table267))
    - Media clip data ([Table 276](#table276))
    - Media clip section ([Table 278](#table278))
    - Media play parameters ([Table 280](#table280))
    - Media screen parameters ([Table 283](#table283))

## 13.2.3 演绎版

**13.2.3 Renditions**

### 13.2.3.1 概述

**13.2.3.1 General**

=== "中文"

    There are two types of *rendition* objects:
    
    - A media rendition (see [13.2.3.2], “Media Renditions”) is a basic media object that specifies what to play, how to play it, and where to play it.
    - A selector rendition (see [13.2.3.3], “Selector Renditions”) contains an ordered list of renditions. This list may include other selector renditions, resulting in a tree whose leaves are media renditions. The conforming reader should play the first viable media rendition it encounters in the tree (see [13.2.2], “Viability”).
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        [Table 266](#table266) shows the entries common to all rendition dictionaries. The N entry in a rendition dictionary specifies a name that can be used to access the rendition object by means of name tree lookup (see [Table 31](../c7/s7.md#table31)). JavaScript actions (see [12.6.4.16], “JavaScript Actions”), for example, use this mechanism. Since the values referenced by name trees shall be indirect objects, all rendition objects should be indirect objects.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        A rendition dictionary is not required to have a name tree entry. When it does, the conforming reader should ensure that the name specified in the tree is kept the same as the value of the N entry (for example, if the user interface allows the name to be changed). A document should not contain multiple renditions with the same name.
    
    The **MH** and **BE** entries are dictionaries whose entries may be present in one or the other of them, as described in [13.2.2], “Viability.” For renditions, these dictionaries shall have a single entry C (see [Table 267](#table267)), whose value shall have a media criteria dictionary specifying a set of criteria that shall be met for the rendition to be considered viable (see [Table 268](#table268)).
    
    The media criteria dictionary behaves somewhat differently than other **MH/BE** entries, as they are described in [13.2.2], “Viability.” The criteria specified by all of its entries shall be met regardless of whether they are in an **MH** or a **BE** dictionary. The only exception is that if an entry in a **BE** dictionary is unrecognized by the conforming reader, it shall not affect the viability of the object. If a media criteria dictionary is present in both **MH** and **BE**, the entries in both dictionaries shall be individually evaluated, with MH taking precedence (corresponding **BE** entries shall be ignored).

    There are two types of *rendition* objects:
    
    - A media rendition (see [13.2.3.2], “Media Renditions”) is a basic media object that specifies what to play, how to play it, and where to play it.
    - A selector rendition (see [13.2.3.3], “Selector Renditions”) contains an ordered list of renditions. This list may include other selector renditions, resulting in a tree whose leaves are media renditions. The conforming reader should play the first viable media rendition it encounters in the tree (see [13.2.2], “Viability”).
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        [Table 266](#table266) shows the entries common to all rendition dictionaries. The N entry in a rendition dictionary specifies a name that can be used to access the rendition object by means of name tree lookup (see [Table 31](../c7/s7.md#table31)). JavaScript actions (see [12.6.4.16], “JavaScript Actions”), for example, use this mechanism. Since the values referenced by name trees shall be indirect objects, all rendition objects should be indirect objects.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        A rendition dictionary is not required to have a name tree entry. When it does, the conforming reader should ensure that the name specified in the tree is kept the same as the value of the N entry (for example, if the user interface allows the name to be changed). A document should not contain multiple renditions with the same name.
    
    The **MH** and **BE** entries are dictionaries whose entries may be present in one or the other of them, as described in [13.2.2], “Viability.” For renditions, these dictionaries shall have a single entry C (see [Table 267](#table267)), whose value shall have a media criteria dictionary specifying a set of criteria that shall be met for the rendition to be considered viable (see [Table 268](#table268)).
    
    The media criteria dictionary behaves somewhat differently than other **MH/BE** entries, as they are described in [13.2.2], “Viability.” The criteria specified by all of its entries shall be met regardless of whether they are in an **MH** or a **BE** dictionary. The only exception is that if an entry in a **BE** dictionary is unrecognized by the conforming reader, it shall not affect the viability of the object. If a media criteria dictionary is present in both **MH** and **BE**, the entries in both dictionaries shall be individually evaluated, with MH taking precedence (corresponding **BE** entries shall be ignored).

**13.2.3.3 Selector Renditions**

=== "中文"

    A *selector rendition dictionary* shall specify an array of rendition objects in its **R** entry (see [Table 272](#table272)). The renditions in this array should be ordered by preference, with the most preferred rendition first. At play-time, the renditions in the array shall be evaluated and the first viable media rendition, if any, shall be played. If one of the renditions is itself a selector, that selector shall be evaluated in turn, yielding the equivalent of a depth-first tree search. A selector rendition itself may be non-viable; in this case, none of its associated media renditions shall be evaluated (in effect, this branch of the tree is skipped).
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
        This mechanism may be used, for example, to specify that a large video clip should be used on high-bandwidth machines and a smaller clip should be used on low-bandwidth machines.

    The media clip data object shall be considered non-viable if the object referenced by the **D** entry does not contain a **Type** entry, the **Type** entry is unrecognized, or the referenced object is not a dictionary or stream.
    
    This shall effectively exclude the use of simple file specifications (see [7.11], “File Specifications”).
    
    If **D** references a file specification that has an embedded file stream (see [7.11.4], “Embedded File Streams”), the embedded file stream’s **Subtype** entry shall be ignored if present, and the media clip data dictionary’s **CT** entry shall identify the type of data.
    
    If **D** references a form XObject, the associated player is implicitly the conforming reader, and the form XObject
    shall be rendered as if it were any other data type.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        The **F** and **D** entries in the media play parameters dictionary (see [Table 279](#table279)) should apply to a form XObject just as they do to a QuickTime movie.
    
    For media other than form XObjects, the media clip object shall provide enough information to allow a conforming reader to locate an appropriate player. This may be done by providing one or both of the following entries, the first being the preferred method:
    
    - A **CT** entry that specifies the content type of the media. If this entry is present, any player that is selected shall support this content type.
    - A **PL** entry that specifies one or more players that may be used to play the referenced media. if **CT** is present, there should also be a **PL** present.
    
    The **P** entry specifies a *media permissions dictionary* (see [Table 275](#table275)) specifying the manner in which the data referenced by the media may be used by a conforming reader. These permissions allow authors control over how their data is exposed to operations that could allow it to be copied. If the dictionary contains unrecognized entries or entries with unrecognized values, it shall be considered non-viable, and the conforming reader shall not play the media.

                    (TEMPACCESS) Allowed only if the document permissions allow content extraction, including for accessibility purposes; when bits 5 or 10 of the user access permissions (see [Table 22](../c7/s6.md#table22)) are set, or both. <br/>

    The **BU** entry in the media clip data **MH** and **BE** dictionaries (see [Table 276](#table276)) specifies a base URL for the media data. Relative URLs in the media (which point to auxiliary files or are used for hyperlinking) should be resolved with respect to the value of **BU**. The following are additional requirements concerning the **BU** entry:
    
    - If **BU** is in the **MH** dictionary and the base URL is not honoured the media clip data shall be non-viable.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 3"
    
        An example of this is that the player does not accept base URLs.
    
    - Determining the viability of the object shall not require checking whether the base URL is valid
    
    !!! note "NOTE 4"
    
        The target host exists.
    
    - Absolute URls within the media shall not be affected.
    - If the media itself contains a base URL, that value shall be used in preference to **BU**.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 5"
    
        An example of this is that the &lt;BASE&gt; element is defined in HTML.
    
    - BU is completely independent of and unrelated to the value of the URI entry in the document catalogu (see [7.7.2], “Document Catalog”).
    - If BU is not present and the media is embedded within the document, the URL to the PDF file itself shall be used as if it were the value of a BU entry in the BE dictionary; that is, as an implicit best-effort base URL.

    The media clip data object shall be considered non-viable if the object referenced by the **D** entry does not contain a **Type** entry, the **Type** entry is unrecognized, or the referenced object is not a dictionary or stream.
    
    This shall effectively exclude the use of simple file specifications (see [7.11], “File Specifications”).
    
    If **D** references a file specification that has an embedded file stream (see [7.11.4], “Embedded File Streams”), the embedded file stream’s **Subtype** entry shall be ignored if present, and the media clip data dictionary’s **CT** entry shall identify the type of data.
    
    If **D** references a form XObject, the associated player is implicitly the conforming reader, and the form XObject
    shall be rendered as if it were any other data type.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        The **F** and **D** entries in the media play parameters dictionary (see [Table 279](#table279)) should apply to a form XObject just as they do to a QuickTime movie.
    
    For media other than form XObjects, the media clip object shall provide enough information to allow a conforming reader to locate an appropriate player. This may be done by providing one or both of the following entries, the first being the preferred method:
    
    - A **CT** entry that specifies the content type of the media. If this entry is present, any player that is selected shall support this content type.
    - A **PL** entry that specifies one or more players that may be used to play the referenced media. if **CT** is present, there should also be a **PL** present.
    
    The **P** entry specifies a *media permissions dictionary* (see [Table 275](#table275)) specifying the manner in which the data referenced by the media may be used by a conforming reader. These permissions allow authors control over how their data is exposed to operations that could allow it to be copied. If the dictionary contains unrecognized entries or entries with unrecognized values, it shall be considered non-viable, and the conforming reader shall not play the media.

                    (TEMPEXTRACT) &emsp; Allowed only if the document permissions allow content extraction; when bit 5 of the user access permissions (see [Table 22](../c7/s6.md#table22)) is set. <br/>
                    (TEMPACCESS) Allowed only if the document permissions allow content extraction, including for accessibility purposes; when bits 5 or 10 of the user access permissions (see [Table 22](../c7/s6.md#table22)) are set, or both. <br/>

    The **BU** entry in the media clip data **MH** and **BE** dictionaries (see [Table 276](#table276)) specifies a base URL for the media data. Relative URLs in the media (which point to auxiliary files or are used for hyperlinking) should be resolved with respect to the value of **BU**. The following are additional requirements concerning the **BU** entry:
    
    - If **BU** is in the **MH** dictionary and the base URL is not honoured the media clip data shall be non-viable.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 3"
    
        An example of this is that the player does not accept base URLs.
    
    - Determining the viability of the object shall not require checking whether the base URL is valid
    
    !!! note "NOTE 4"
    
        The target host exists.
    
    - Absolute URls within the media shall not be affected.
    - If the media itself contains a base URL, that value shall be used in preference to **BU**.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 5"
    
        An example of this is that the &lt;BASE&gt; element is defined in HTML.
    
    - BU is completely independent of and unrelated to the value of the URI entry in the document catalogu (see [7.7.2], “Document Catalog”).
    - If BU is not present and the media is embedded within the document, the URL to the PDF file itself shall be used as if it were the value of a BU entry in the BE dictionary; that is, as an implicit best-effort base URL.
