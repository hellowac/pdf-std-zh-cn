**13.3 Sounds**

=== "中文"

    A *sound object (PDF 1.2)* shall be a stream containing sample values that define a sound to be played through the computer’s speakers. The **Sound** entry in a sound annotation or sound action dictionary (see [Table 185](../c12/s5.md#table185) and Table 208) shall identify a sound object representing the sound to be played when the annotation is activated.
    
    Since a sound object is a stream, it may contain any of the standard entries common to all streams, as described in Table 5. In particular, if it contains an **F** (file specification) entry, the sound shall be defined in an external file. This sound file shall be self-describing, containing all information needed to render the sound; no additional information need be present in the PDF file.
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
        The AIFF, AIFF-C (Mac OS), RIFF (. wav), and snd (. au) file formats are all self-describing.
    
    If no **F** entry is present, the sound object itself shall contain the sample data and all other information needed to define the sound. Table 294 shows the additional dictionary entries specific to a sound object.

    Sample values shall be stored in the stream with the most significant bits first (big-endian order for samples larger than 8 bits). Samples that are not a multiple of 8 bits shall be packed into consecutive bytes, starting at the most significant end. If a sample extends across a byte boundary, the most significant bits shall be placed in the first byte, followed by less significant bits in subsequent bytes. For dual-channel stereophonic sounds, the samples shall be stored in an interleaved format, with each sample value for the left channel (channel 1) preceding the corresponding sample for the right (channel 2).
    
    To maximize the portability of PDF documents containing embedded sounds, conforming readers should support at least the following formats (assuming the platform has sufficient hardware and OS support to play sounds at all):
    
    **R** 8000, 11,025, or 22,050 samples per second
    **C** 1 or 2 channels
    **B** 8 or 16 bits per channel
    **E** Raw, Signed, or muLaw encoding
    
    If the encoding (**E**) is Raw or Signed, **R** shall be 11,025 or 22,050 samples per channel. If the encoding is muLaw, **R** shall be 8000 samples per channel, **C** shall be 1 channel, and **B** shall be 8 bits per channel. Sound players shall convert between formats, downsample rates, and combine channels as necessary to render sound on the target platform.
