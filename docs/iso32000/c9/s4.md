**Text Objects**

## 9.4.1 概述

**General**

=== "中文"

    A PDF *text object* consists of operators that may show text strings, move the text position, and set text state and certain other parameters. In addition, three parameters may be specified only within a text object and shall not persist from one text object to the next:
    
    - $T_{m}$ , the *text matrix*
    - $T_{lm}$ , the *text line matrix*
    - $T_{rm}$ , the *text rendering matrix*, which is actually just an intermediate result that combines the effects of text state parameters, the text matrix ($T_m$ ), and the current transformation matrix
    
    A text object begins with the **BT** operator and ends with the **ET** operator, as shown in the Example, and
    described in [Table 107](#table107).
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE"
    
        **BT**

    These specific categories of text-related operators may appear in a text object:
    
    - *Text state operators*, described in [9.3], "Text State Parameters and Operators"
    - *Text-positioning operators*, described in [9.4.2], "Text-Positioning Operators"
    - *Text-showing operators*, described in [9.4.3], "Text-Showing Operators"
    
    The latter two sub-clauses also provide further details about these text object parameters. The other operators that may appear in a text object are those related to the general graphics state, colour, and marked content, as shown in Figure 9.
    
    If a content stream does not contain any text, the ***Text*** procedure set may be omitted (see [14.2], "Procedure Sets"). In those circumstances, no text operators (including operators that merely set the text state) shall be present in the content stream, since those operators are defined in the same procedure set.
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
        Although text objects cannot be statically nested, text might be shown using a Type 3 font whose glyph descriptions include any graphics objects, including another text object. Likewise, the current colour might be a tiling pattern whose pattern cell includes a text object.

**Text-Positioning Operators**

=== "中文"

    Text space is the coordinate system in which text is shown. It shall be defined by the text matrix, $T_m$ , and the text state parameters $T_fs$ , $T_h$ , and $T_{rise}$ , which together shall determine the transformation from text space to user space. Specifically, the origin of the first glyph shown by a text-showing operator shall be placed at the origin of text space. If text space has been translated, scaled, or rotated, then the position, size, or orientation of the glyph in user space shall be correspondingly altered.
    
    The text-positioning operators shall only appear within text objects.

**Text-Showing Operators**

=== "中文"

    The *text-showing operators* (Table 109) shall show text on the page, repositioning text space as they do so. All of the operators shall interpret the text string and apply the text state parameters as described in Table 109.

If the element is a string, this operator shall show the string. If it is a number, the operator shall adjust the text position by that amount; that is, it shall translate the text matrix, $T_m$ . The number shall be expressed in thousandths of a unit of text space (see [9.4.4], "Text Space Details"). This amount shall be subtracted from the current horizontal or vertical coordinate, depending on the writing mode. In the default coordinate system, a positive adjustment has the effect of moving the next glyph painted either to the left or down by the given amount. Figure 46 shows an example of the effect of passing offsets to **TJ**.

    A string operand of a text-showing operator shall be interpreted as a sequence of character codes identifying the glyphs to be painted.
    
    With a simple font, each byte of the string shall be treated as a separate character code. The character code shall then be looked up in the font’s encoding to select the glyph, as described in [9.6.6], "Character Encoding".
    
    With a composite font (PDF 1.2), multiple-byte codes may be used to select glyphs. In this instance, one or more consecutive bytes of the string shall be treated as a single character code. The code lengths and the mappings from codes to glyphs are defined in a data structure called a *CMap*, described in [9.7], "Composite Fonts".
    
    The strings shall conform to the syntax for string objects. When a string is written by enclosing the data in parentheses, bytes whose values are equal to those of the ASCII characters LEFT PARENTHESIS (28h), RIGHT PARENTHESIS (29h), and REVERSE SOLIDUS (5Ch) (backslash) shall be preceded by a REVERSE SOLIDUS) character. All other byte values between 0 and 255 may be used in a string object. These rules apply to each individual byte in a string object, whether the string is interpreted by the text-showing operators as single-byte or multiple-byte character codes.
    
    Strings presented to the text-showing operators may be of any length—even a single character code per string—and may be placed on the page in any order. The grouping of glyphs into strings has no significance for the display of text. Showing multiple glyphs with one invocation of a text-showing operator such as **Tj** shall produce the same results as showing them with a separate invocation for each glyph.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 6"
    
        The performance of text searching (and other text extraction operations) is significantly better if the text strings are as long as possible and are shown in natural reading order.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 7"
    
        In some cases, the text that is extracted can vary depending on the grouping of glyphs into strings. See, for example, [14.8.2.3.3], "Reverse-Order Show Strings".

If the element is a string, this operator shall show the string. If it is a number, the operator shall adjust the text position by that amount; that is, it shall translate the text matrix, $T_m$ . The number shall be expressed in thousandths of a unit of text space (see [9.4.4], "Text Space Details"). This amount shall be subtracted from the current horizontal or vertical coordinate, depending on the writing mode. In the default coordinate system, a positive adjustment has the effect of moving the next glyph painted either to the left or down by the given amount. Figure 46 shows an example of the effect of passing offsets to **TJ**.

    A string operand of a text-showing operator shall be interpreted as a sequence of character codes identifying the glyphs to be painted.
    
    With a simple font, each byte of the string shall be treated as a separate character code. The character code shall then be looked up in the font’s encoding to select the glyph, as described in [9.6.6], "Character Encoding".
    
    With a composite font (PDF 1.2), multiple-byte codes may be used to select glyphs. In this instance, one or more consecutive bytes of the string shall be treated as a single character code. The code lengths and the mappings from codes to glyphs are defined in a data structure called a *CMap*, described in [9.7], "Composite Fonts".
    
    The strings shall conform to the syntax for string objects. When a string is written by enclosing the data in parentheses, bytes whose values are equal to those of the ASCII characters LEFT PARENTHESIS (28h), RIGHT PARENTHESIS (29h), and REVERSE SOLIDUS (5Ch) (backslash) shall be preceded by a REVERSE SOLIDUS) character. All other byte values between 0 and 255 may be used in a string object. These rules apply to each individual byte in a string object, whether the string is interpreted by the text-showing operators as single-byte or multiple-byte character codes.
    
    Strings presented to the text-showing operators may be of any length—even a single character code per string—and may be placed on the page in any order. The grouping of glyphs into strings has no significance for the display of text. Showing multiple glyphs with one invocation of a text-showing operator such as **Tj** shall produce the same results as showing them with a separate invocation for each glyph.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 6"
    
        The performance of text searching (and other text extraction operations) is significantly better if the text strings are as long as possible and are shown in natural reading order.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 7"
    
        In some cases, the text that is extracted can vary depending on the grouping of glyphs into strings. See, for example, [14.8.2.3.3], "Reverse-Order Show Strings".

**Text Space Details**

=== "中文"

    As stated in [9.4.2], "Text-Positioning Operators", text shall be shown in text space, defined by the combination of the text matrix, $T_m$ , and the text state parameters $T_{fs}$ , $T_h$ , and $T_{rise}$ . This determines how text coordinates are transformed into user space. Both the glyph’s shape and its displacement (horizontal or vertical) shall be interpreted in text space.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        Glyphs are actually defined in glyph space, whose definition varies according to the font type as discussed in [9.2.4], "Glyph Positioning and Metrics". Glyph coordinates are first transformed from glyph space to text space before being subjected to the transformations described in Note 2.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        Conceptually, the entire transformation from text space to device space may be represented by a *text rendering matrix, Trm* :
    
        $$
        T_{rm} = \begin{bmatrix}
         T_{fs} \times T_h & 0 & 0\\
         0 & T_{fs} & 0\\
         0 & T_{rise} & 1
        \end{bmatrix} \times T_m \times CTM
        $$
    
        *Trm* is a temporary matrix; conceptually, it is recomputed before each glyph is painted during a text-showing operation.
    
    After the glyph is painted, the text matrix shall be updated according to the glyph displacement and any spacing parameters that apply. First, a combined displacement shall be computed, denoted by $t_x$ in horizontal writing mode or $t_y$ in vertical writing mode (the variable corresponding to the other writing mode shall be set to 0):
    
    $$
    \begin{align} 
      t_x &= \left( \left(w0 - \frac{T_j}{1000} \right) \times T_{fs} + T_c + T_w \right ) \times T_h \\
      t_y &= \left( w1 - \frac{t_j}{1000} \right) \times T_{fs} + T_c + T_w
    \end{align}
    $$
    
    where
    
    - $w0$ and $w1$ denote the glyph’s horizontal and vertical displacements
    - $T_j$ denotes a number in a **TJ** array, if any, which specifies a position adjustment
    - $T_{fs}$ and $T_h$ denote the current text font size and horizontal scaling parameters in the graphics state
    - $T_c$ and $T_w$ denote the current character- and word-spacing parameters in the graphics state, if applicable
    
    The text matrix shall then be then updated as follows:
    
    $$
    T_m = \begin{bmatrix}
     1 & 0 & 0\\
     0 & 1 & 0\\
     t_x & t_y & 1
    \end{bmatrix} \times T_m
    $$
