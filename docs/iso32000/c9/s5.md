**9.5 Introduction to Font Data Structures**

=== "中文"

    A font shall be represented in PDF as a dictionary specifying the type of font, its PostScript name, its encoding, and information that can be used to provide a substitute when the font program is not available. Optionally, the font program may be embedded as a stream object in the PDF file.
    
    The font types are distinguished by the **Subtype** entry in the font dictionary. Table 110 lists the font types defined in PDF. Type 0 fonts are called *composite fonts*; other types of fonts are called simple fonts. In addition to fonts, PDF supports two classes of font-related objects, called *CIDFonts* and *CMaps*, described in [9.7.2], "CID-Keyed Fonts Overview". CIDFonts are listed in Table 110 because, like fonts, they are collections of glyphs; however, a CIDFont shall not be used directly but only as a component of a Type 0 font.

    For all font types, the term *font dictionary* refers to a PDF dictionary containing information about the font; likewise, a *CIDFont dictionary* contains information about a CIDFont. Except for Type 3, this dictionary is distinct from the font program that defines the font’s glyphs. That font program may be embedded in the PDF file as a stream object or be obtained from some external source.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        This terminology differs from that used in the PostScript language. In PostScript, a font dictionary is a PostScript data structure that is created as a direct result of interpreting a font program. In PDF, a font program is always treated as if it were a separate file, even when its content is embedded in the PDF file. The font program is interpreted by a specialized font interpreter when necessary; its contents never materialize as PDF objects.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        Most font programs (and related programs, such as CIDFonts and CMaps) conform to external specifications, such as the *Adobe Type 1 Font Format*. This standard does not include those specifications. See the Bibliography for more information about the specifications mentioned in this clause.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 3"
    
        The most predictable and dependable results are produced when all font programs used to show text are embedded in the PDF file. The following sub-clauses describe precisely how to do so. If a PDF file refers to font programs that are not embedded, the results depend on the availability of fonts in the conforming reader’s environment. The following sub-clauses specify some conventions for referring to external font programs. However, some details of font naming, font substitution, and glyph selection are implementation-dependent and may vary among different conforming readers, writers and operating system environments.
