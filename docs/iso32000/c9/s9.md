**9.9 Embedded Font Programs**

=== "中文"

    A font program may be embedded in a PDF file as data contained in a PDF stream object.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        Such a stream object is also called a *font file* by analogy with font programs that are available from sources external to the conforming writer.
    
    Font programs are subject to copyright, and the copyright owner may impose conditions under which a font program may be used. These permissions are recorded either in the font program or as part of a separate license. One of the conditions may be that the font program cannot be embedded, in which case it should not be incorporated into a PDF file. A font program may allow embedding for the sole purpose of viewing and printing the document but not for creating new or modified text that uses the font (in either the same document or other documents). The latter operation would require the user performing the operation to have a licensed copy of the font program, not a copy extracted from the PDF file. In the absence of explicit information to the contrary, embedded font programs shall be used only to view and print the document and not for any other purposes.
    
    [Table 126](#table126) summarizes the ways in which font programs shall be embedded in a PDF file, depending on the representation of the font program. The key shall be the name used in the font descriptor to refer to the font file stream; the subtype shall be the value of the **Subtype** key, if present, in the font file stream dictionary. Further details of specific font program representations are given below.

    - A **CIDFontType0** CIDFont dictionary, if the embedded font program contains a “CFF ” table (notice the trailing SPACE) with a Top DICT that uses CIDFont operators (this is equivalent to subtype **CIDFontType0C**).

        A standard Type 1 font program, as described in the *Adobe Type 1 Font Format* specification, consists of three parts: a clear-text portion (written using PostScript syntax), an encrypted portion, and a fixed-content portion. The fixed-content portion contains 512 ASCII zeros followed by a **cleartomark** operator, and perhaps followed by additional data. Although the encrypted portion of a standard Type 1 font may be in binary or ASCII hexadecimal format, PDF supports only the binary format. However, the entire font program may be encoded using any filters.

        This code shows the structure of an embedded standard Type 1 font.

    As noted in [Table 126](#table126), a Type 1–equivalent font program or a Type 0 CIDFont program may be represented in the Compact Font Format (CFF). The **Length1**, **Length2**, and **Length3** entries are not needed in that case and shall not be present. Although CFF enables multiple font or CIDFont programs to be bundled together in a single file, an embedded CFF font file in PDF shall consist of exactly one font or CIDFont (as appropriate for the associated font dictionary).
    
    According to the Adobe Type 1 Font Format specification, a Type 1 font program may contain a ***PaintType*** entry specifying whether the glyphs’ outlines are to be filled or stroked. For fonts embedded in a PDF file, this entry shall be ignored; the decision whether to fill or stroke glyph outlines is entirely determined by the PDF text rendering mode parameter (see [9.3.6](./s3.md#936-文本渲染模式), "Text Rendering Mode"). This shall also applies to Type 1 compact fonts and Type 0 compact CIDFonts.
    
    A TrueType font program may be used as part of either a font or a CIDFont. Although the basic font file format is the same in both cases, there are different requirements for what information shall be present in the font program. These TrueType tables shall always be present if present in the original TrueType font program: “head”, “hhea”, “loca”, “maxp”, “cvt”, “prep”, “glyf”, “hmtx”, and “fpgm”. If used with a simple font dictionary, the font program shall additionally contain a cmap table defining one or more encodings, as discussed in [9.6.6.4], "Encodings for TrueType Fonts". If used with a CIDFont dictionary, the cmap table is not needed and shall not be present, since the mapping from character codes to glyph descriptions is provided separately.
    
    The “vhea” and “vmtx” tables that specify vertical metrics shall never be used by a conforming reader. The only way to specify vertical metrics in PDF shall be by means of the **DW2** and **W2** entries in a CIDFont dictionary.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 3"
    
        Beginning with PDF 1.6, font programs may be embedded using the OpenType format, which is an extension of the TrueType format that allows inclusion of font programs using the Compact Font Format (CFF). It also allows inclusion of data to describe glyph substitutions, kerning, and baseline adjustments. In addition to rendering glyphs, conforming readers may use the data in OpenType fonts to do advanced line layout, automatically substitute ligatures, provide selections of alternate glyphs to users, and handle complex writing scripts.
    
    The process of finding glyph descriptions in OpenType fonts by a conforming reader shall be the following:
    
    - For Type 1 fonts using “CFF” tables, the process shall be as described in [9.6.6.2], "Encodings for Type 1 Fonts".
    - For TrueType fonts using “glyf” tables, the process shall be as described in [9.6.6.4], "Encodings for TrueType Fonts". Since this process sometimes produces ambiguous results, conforming writers, instead of using a simple font, shall use a Type 0 font with an Identity-H encoding and use the glyph indices as character codes, as described following [Table 118](./s7.md#table118).
    - For **CIDFontType0** fonts using “CFF” tables, the process shall be as described in the discussion of embedded Type 0 CIDFonts in [9.7.4.2], "Glyph Selection in CIDFonts".
    - For **CIDFontType2** fonts using “glyf” tables, the process shall be as described in the discussion of embedded Type 2 CIDFonts in [9.7.4.2], "Glyph Selection in CIDFonts".
    
    As discussed in [9.6.4], "Font Subsets", an embedded font program may contain only the subset of glyphs that are used in the PDF document. This may be indicated by the presence of a **CharSet** or **CIDSet** entry in the font descriptor that refers to the font file.

        Such a stream object is also called a *font file* by analogy with font programs that are available from sources external to the conforming writer.
    
    Font programs are subject to copyright, and the copyright owner may impose conditions under which a font program may be used. These permissions are recorded either in the font program or as part of a separate license. One of the conditions may be that the font program cannot be embedded, in which case it should not be incorporated into a PDF file. A font program may allow embedding for the sole purpose of viewing and printing the document but not for creating new or modified text that uses the font (in either the same document or other documents). The latter operation would require the user performing the operation to have a licensed copy of the font program, not a copy extracted from the PDF file.

If used with a CIDFont dictionary, the cmap table is not needed and shall not be present, since the mapping from character codes to glyph descriptions is provided separately.
    
    The “vhea” and “vmtx” tables that specify vertical metrics shall never be used by a conforming reader. The only way to specify vertical metrics in PDF shall be by means of the **DW2** and **W2** entries in a CIDFont dictionary.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 3"
    
        Beginning with PDF 1.6, font programs may be embedded using the OpenType format, which is an extension of the TrueType format that allows inclusion of font programs using the Compact Font Format (CFF). It also allows inclusion of data to describe glyph substitutions, kerning, and baseline adjustments. In addition to rendering glyphs, conforming readers may use the data in OpenType fonts to do advanced line layout, automatically substitute ligatures, provide selections of alternate glyphs to users, and handle complex writing scripts.
    
    The process of finding glyph descriptions in OpenType fonts by a conforming reader shall be the following:
    
    - For Type 1 fonts using “CFF” tables, the process shall be as described in [9.6.6.2], "Encodings for Type 1 Fonts".
    - For TrueType fonts using “glyf” tables, the process shall be as described in [9.6.6.4], "Encodings for TrueType Fonts". Since this process sometimes produces ambiguous results, conforming writers, instead of using a simple font, shall use a Type 0 font with an Identity-H encoding and use the glyph indices as character codes, as described following [Table 118](./s7.md#table118).
    - For **CIDFontType0** fonts using “CFF” tables, the process shall be as described in the discussion of embedded Type 0 CIDFonts in [9.7.4.2], "Glyph Selection in CIDFonts".
    - For **CIDFontType2** fonts using “glyf” tables, the process shall be as described in the discussion of embedded Type 2 CIDFonts in [9.7.4.2], "Glyph Selection in CIDFonts".
    
    As discussed in [9.6.4], "Font Subsets", an embedded font program may contain only the subset of glyphs that are used in the PDF document. This may be indicated by the presence of a **CharSet** or **CIDSet** entry in the font descriptor that refers to the font file.
