**Composite Fonts**

## 9.7.1 概述

**General**

=== "中文"

    A *composite font*, also called a Type 0 font, is one whose glyphs are obtained from a fontlike object called a CIDFont. A composite font shall be represented by a font dictionary whose **Subtype** value is **Type0**. The Type 0 font is known as the root font, and its associated CIDFont is called its *descendant*.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        Composite fonts in PDF are analogous to composite fonts in PostScript but with some limitations. In particular, PDF requires that the character encoding be defined by a CMap, which is only one of several encoding methods available in PostScript. Also, PostScript allows a Type 0 font to have multiple descendants, which might also be Type 0 fonts. PDF supports only a single descendant, which shall be a CIDFont.
    
    When the current font is composite, the text-showing operators shall behave differently than with simple fonts. For simple fonts, each byte of a string to be shown selects one glyph, whereas for composite fonts, a sequence of one or more bytes are decoded to select a glyph from the descendant CIDFont.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 2"
    
        This facility supports the use of very large character sets, such as those for the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages. It also simplifies the organization of fonts that have complex encoding requirements.
    
    This sub-clause first introduces the architecture of *CID-keyed fonts*, which are the only kind of composite font supported in PDF. Then it describes the *CIDFont* and *CMap* dictionaries, which are the PDF objects that represent the correspondingly named components of a CID-keyed font. Finally, it describes the Type 0 font dictionary, which combines a CIDFont and a CMap to produce a font whose glyphs may be accessed by means of variable-length character codes in a string to be shown.

## 9.7.2 CID 键控字体概述

**CID-Keyed Fonts Overview**

=== "中文"

    CID-keyed fonts provide a convenient and efficient method for defining multiple-byte character encodings and fonts with a large number of glyphs. These capabilities provide great flexibility for representing text in writing systems for languages with large character sets, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK).
    
    The CID-keyed font architecture specifies the external representation of certain font programs, called CMap and CIDFont files, along with some conventions for combining and using those files. As mentioned earlier, PDF does not support the entire CID-keyed font architecture, which is independent of PDF; CID-keyed fonts may be used in other environments.
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
        For complete documentation on the architecture and the file formats, see Adobe Technical Notes #5092, CID-Keyed Font Technology Overview, and #5014, Adobe CMap and CIDFont Files Specification. This sub-clause describes only the PDF objects that represent these font programs.
    
    The term *CID-keyed* font reflects the fact that CID (character identifier) numbers are used to index and access the glyph descriptions in the font. This method is more efficient for large fonts than the method of accessing by character name, as is used for some simple fonts. CIDs range from 0 to a maximum value that may be subject to an implementation limit (see [Table C.1]).
    
    A character collection is an ordered set of glyphs. The order of the glyphs in the character collection shall determine the CID number for each glyph. Each CID-keyed font shall explicitly reference the character collection on which its CID numbers are based; see [9.7.3], "CIDSystemInfo Dictionaries".
    
    A CMap (character map) file shall specify the correspondence between character codes and the CID numbers used to identify glyphs. It is equivalent to the concept of an encoding in simple fonts. Whereas a simple font allows a maximum of 256 glyphs to be encoded and accessible at one time, a CMap can describe a mapping from multiple-byte codes to thousands of glyphs in a large CID-keyed font.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE"
    
        A CMap can describe Shift-JIS, one of several widely used encodings for Japanese.
    
    A CMap file may reference an entire character collection or a subset of a character collection. The CMap file’s mapping yields a *font number* (which in PDF shall be 0) and a character selector (which in PDF shall be a CID). Furthermore, a CMap file may incorporate another CMap file by reference, without having to duplicate it. These features enable character collections to be combined or supplemented and make all the constituent characters accessible to text-showing operations through a single encoding.
    
    A *CIDFont* contains the glyph descriptions for a character collection. The glyph descriptions themselves are typically in a format similar to those used in simple fonts, such as Type 1. However, they are identified by CIDs rather than by names, and they are organized differently.
    
    In PDF, the data from a CMap file and CIDFont shall be represented by PDF objects as described in [9.7.4], "CIDFonts" and [9.7.5], "CMaps". The CMap file and CIDFont programs themselves may be either referenced by name or embedded as stream objects in the PDF file.
    
    A CID-keyed font, then, shall be the combination of a CMap with a CIDFont containing glyph descriptions. It shall be represented as a Type 0 font. It contains an **Encoding** entry whose value shall be a CMap dictionary, and its **DescendantFonts** entry shall reference the CIDFont dictionary with which the CMap has been combined.

## 9.7.3 CIDSystemInfo 字典

**CIDSystemInfo Dictionaries**

=== "中文"

    CIDFont and CMap dictionaries shall contain a **CIDSystemInfo** entry specifying the character collection assumed by the CIDFont associated with the CMap—that is, the interpretation of the CID numbers used by the CIDFont. A character collection shall be uniquely identified by the **Registry**, **Ordering**, and **Supplement** entries in the **CIDSystemInfo** dictionary, as described in Table 116. In order to be compatible, the Registry and Ordering values must be the same.
    
    The **CIDSystemInfo** entry in a CIDFont is a dictionary that shall specify the CIDFont’s character collection. The CIDFont need not contain glyph descriptions for all the CIDs in a collection; it may contain a subset. The **CIDSystemInfo** entry in a CMap file shall be either a single dictionary or an array of dictionaries, depending on whether it associates codes with a single character collection or with multiple character collections; see [9.7.5], "CMaps".
    
    For proper behaviour, the **CIDSystemInfo** entry of a CMap shall be compatible with that of the CIDFont or CIDFonts with which it is used.

**CIDFonts**

### 9.7.4.1 概述

**General**

=== "中文"

    A CIDFont program contains glyph descriptions that are accessed using a CID as the character selector. There are two types of CIDFonts:
    
    - A Type 0 CIDFont contains glyph descriptions based on CFF
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
    - The term “Type 0” when applied to a CIDFont has a different meaning than for a “Type 0 font”.
    
    A Type 2 CIDFont contains glyph descriptions based on the TrueType font format
    
    A CIDFont dictionary is a PDF object that contains information about a CIDFont program. Although its **Type** value is **Font**, a CIDFont is not actually a font. It does not have an **Encoding** entry, it may not be listed in the **Font** subdictionary of a resource dictionary, and it may not be used as the operand of the **Tf** operator. It shall be used only as a descendant of a Type 0 font. The CMap in the Type 0 font shall be what defines the encoding that maps character codes to CIDs in the CIDFont. [Table 117](#table117) lists the entries in a CIDFont dictionary.

**Glyph Selection in CIDFonts**

=== "中文"

    Type 0 and Type 2 CIDFonts handle the mapping from CIDs to glyph descriptions in somewhat different ways.
    
    For Type 0, the CIDFont program contains glyph descriptions that are identified by CIDs. The CIDFont program identifies the character collection by a **CIDSystemInfo** dictionary, which should be copied into the PDF CIDFont dictionary. CIDs shall be interpreted uniformly in all CIDFont programs supporting a given character collection, whether the program is embedded in the PDF file or obtained from an external source.
    
    When the CIDFont contains an embedded font program that is represented in the Compact Font Format (CFF), the **FontFile3** entry in the font descriptor (see [Table 126](./s9.md#table126)) may be **CIDFontType0C** or **OpenType**. There are two cases, depending on the contents of the font program:
    
    - The “CFF” font program has a Top DICT that uses CIDFont operators: The CIDs shall be used to determine the GID value for the glyph procedure using the charset table in the CFF program. The GID value shall then be used to look up the glyph procedure using the CharStrings INDEX table.
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
        Although in many fonts the CID value and GID value are the same, the CID and GID values may differ.
    
    - The “CFF” font program has a Top DICT that does not use CIDFont operators: The CIDs shall be used directly as GID values, and the glyph procedure shall be retrieved using the CharStrings INDEX.
    
    For Type 2, the CIDFont program is actually a TrueType font program, which has no native notion of CIDs. In a TrueType font program, glyph descriptions are identified by glyph index values. Glyph indices are internal to the font and are not defined consistently from one font to another. Instead, a TrueType font program contains a “cmap” table that provides mappings directly from character codes to glyph indices for one or more predefined encodings.
    
    TrueType font programs are integrated with the CID-keyed font architecture in one of two ways, depending on whether the font program is embedded in the PDF file:
    
    - If the TrueType font program is embedded, the Type 2 CIDFont dictionary shall contain a **CIDToGIDMap* entry that maps CIDs to the glyph indices for the appropriate glyph descriptions in that font program.
    - If the TrueType font program is not embedded but is referenced by name, the Type 2 CIDFont dictionary shall not contain a **CIDToGIDMap** entry, since it is not meaningful to refer to glyph indices in an external font program. In this case, CIDs shall not participate in glyph selection, and only predefined CMaps may be used with this CIDFont (see [9.7.5], "CMaps"). The conforming reader shall select glyphs by translating characters from the encoding specified by the predefined CMap to one of the encodings in the TrueType font’s “cmap” table. The means by which this is accomplished are implementation-dependent.
    
    Even though the CIDs are not used to select glyphs in a Type 2 CIDFont, they shall always be used to determine the glyph metrics, as described in the next sub-clause.
    
    Every CIDFont shall contain a glyph description for CID 0, which is analogous to the . notdef character name in simple fonts (see [9.7.6.3], "Handling Undefined Characters").

**Glyph Metrics in CIDFonts**

=== "中文"

    As discussed in [9.2.4], "Glyph Positioning and Metrics", the *width* of a glyph refers to the horizontal displacement between the origin of the glyph and the origin of the next glyph when writing in horizontal mode. In this mode, the vertical displacement between origins shall be 0. Widths for a CIDFont are defined using the **DW** and **W** entries in the CIDFont dictionary. These widths shall be consistent with the actual widths given in the CIDFont program.
    
    The **W** array allows the definition of widths for individual CIDs. The elements of the array shall be organized in groups of two or three, where each group shall be in one of these two formats:
    
    $$
    \begin{align} 
      &c \qquad [w_1 \qquad w_2 \qquad ... w_n]\\
      &c_{first} \qquad c_{last} \qquad w
    \end{align}
    $$
    
    In the first format, c shall be an integer specifying a starting CID value; it shall be followed by an array of n numbers that shall specify the widths for *n* consecutive CIDs, starting with c. The second format shall define the same width, *w*, for all CIDs in the range cfirst to clast.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE 1"
    
        In this example, the glyphs having CIDs 120, 121, and 122 are 400, 325, and 500 units wide, respectively. CIDs in the range 7080 through 8032 all have a width of 1000 units.
    
        **W** entry example:
    
        ```tex
        /W [ 120 [ 400 325 500 ]
             7080 8032 1000
           ]
        ```
    
    Glyphs from a CIDFont may be shown in vertical writing mode. This is selected by the **WMode** entry in the associated CMap dictionary; see [9.7.5], "CMaps". To be used in this way, the CIDFont shall define the vertical displacement for each glyph and the position vector that relates the horizontal and vertical writing origins.
    
    The default position vector and vertical displacement vector shall be specified by the **DW2** entry in the CIDFont dictionary. **DW2** shall be an array of two values: the vertical component of the position vector v and the vertical component of the displacement vector *w1* (see Figure 40). The horizontal component of the position vector shall be half the glyph width, and that of the displacement vector shall be 0.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE 2"
    
        If the **DW2** entry is
    
        ```tex
        / DW2 [ 880 −1000 ]
        ```
    
        then a glyph’s position vector and vertical displacement vector are
    
        $$
        \begin{align} 
          v &= (w0 {\div} 2, 880)\\
         w1 &= (0, -1000)
        \end{align}
        $$
    
        where *w0* is the width (horizontal displacement) for the same glyph.
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
        A negative value for the vertical component places the origin of the next glyph *below* the current glyph because vertical coordinates in a standard coordinate system increase from bottom to top.
    
    The **W2** array shall define vertical metrics for individual CIDs. The elements of the array shall be organized in groups of two or five, where each group shall be in one of these two formats:
    
    $$
    \begin{align} 
      &c \quad [w1_{1y} \quad v_{1x} \quad  v_{1y} \quad w1_{2y} \quad v_{2x} \quad v_{2y} \quad ...]\\
      &c_{_\text{first}} \quad c_{_\text{last}} \quad w1_{1y} \quad v_{1x} \quad v_{1y}
    \end{align}
    $$
    
    In the first format, c is a starting CID and shall be followed by an array containing numbers interpreted in groups of three. Each group shall consist of the vertical component of the vertical displacement vector *w1* (whose horizontal component shall be 0) followed by the horizontal and vertical components for the position vector v. Successive groups shall define the vertical metrics for consecutive CIDs starting with c. The second format defines a range of CIDs from cfirst to clast , that shall be followed by three numbers that define the vertical metrics for all CIDs in this range.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE 3"
    
        This **W2** entry defines the vertical displacement vector for the glyph with CID 120 as (0, −1000) and the position vector as (250, 772). It also defines the displacement vector for CIDs in the range 7080 through 8032 as (0, −1000) and the position vector as (500, 900).
    
        ```tex
        /W2 [ 120 [ −1000 250 772 ]
              7080 8032 −1000 500 900
            ]
        ```

## 9.7.5 CMaps

**CMaps**

### 9.7.5.1 概述

**General**

=== "中文"

    A CMap shall specify the mapping from character codes to character selectors. In PDF, the character selectors shall be CIDs in a CIDFont (as mentioned earlier, PostScript CMaps can use names or codes as well). A CMap serves a function analogous to the **Encoding** dictionary for a simple font. The CMap shall not refer directly to a specific CIDFont; instead, it shall be combined with it as part of a CID-keyed font, represented in PDF as a Type 0 font dictionary (see [9.7.6], "Type 0 Font Dictionaries"). Within the CMap, the character mappings shall refer to the associated CIDFont by font number, which in PDF shall be 0.
    
    PDF also uses a special type of CMap to map character codes to Unicode values (see [9.10.3], "ToUnicode CMaps").
    
    A CMap shall specify the writing mode—horizontal or vertical—for any CIDFont with which the CMap is combined. The writing mode determines which metrics shall be used when glyphs are painted from that font.
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
        Writing mode is specified as part of the CMap because, in some cases, different shapes are used when writing horizontally and vertically. In such cases, the horizontal and vertical variants of a CMap specify different CIDs for a given character code.
    
    A CMap shall be specified in one of two ways:
    
    - As a name object identifying a predefined CMap, whose value shall be one of the predefined CMap names defined in Table 118.
    - As a stream object whose contents shall be a CMap file.

### 9.7.5.2 预定义 CMap

**Predefined CMaps**

=== "中文"

    Several of the CMaps define mappings from Unicode encodings to character collections. Unicode values appearing in a text string shall be represented in big-endian order (high-order byte first). CMap names containing *“UCS2”* use UCS-2 encoding; names containing *“UTF16”* use UTF-16BE (big-endian) encoding.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        Table 118 lists the names of the predefined CMaps. These CMaps map character codes to CIDs in a single descendant CIDFont. CMaps whose names end in H specify horizontal writing mode; those ending in V specify vertical writing mode.

    A conforming reader shall support all of the character collections listed in Table 119. As noted in [9.7.3], "CIDSystemInfo Dictionaries", a character collection is identified by registry, ordering, and supplement number, and supplements are cumulative; that is, a higher-numbered supplement includes the CIDs contained in lower- numbered supplements, as well as some additional CIDs. Consequently, text encoded according to the predefined CMaps for a given PDF version shall be valid when interpreted by a conforming reader supporting the same or a later PDF version. When interpreted by a conforming reader supporting an earlier PDF version, such text causes an error if a CMap is encountered that is not predefined for that PDF version. If character codes are encountered that were added in a higher-numbered supplement than the one corresponding to the supported PDF version, no characters are displayed for those codes; see [9.7.6.3], "Handling Undefined Characters".
    
    The Identity-H and Identity-V CMaps shall not be used with a non-embedded font. Only standardized character sets may be used.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 4"
    
        If a conforming writer producing a PDF file encounters text to be included that uses CIDs from a higher-numbered supplement than the one corresponding to the PDF version being generated, the application should embed the CMap for the higher-numbered supplement rather than refer to the predefined CMap.
    
    The CMap programs that define the predefined CMaps are available through the ASN Web site.

=== "英文"

    Several of the CMaps define mappings from Unicode encodings to character collections. Unicode values appearing in a text string shall be represented in big-endian order (high-order byte first). CMap names containing *“UCS2”* use UCS-2 encoding; names containing *“UTF16”* use UTF-16BE (big-endian) encoding.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 1"
    
        Table 118 lists the names of the predefined CMaps. These CMaps map character codes to CIDs in a single descendant CIDFont. CMaps whose names end in H specify horizontal writing mode; those ending in V specify vertical writing mode.

    A conforming reader shall support all of the character collections listed in Table 119. As noted in [9.7.3], "CIDSystemInfo Dictionaries", a character collection is identified by registry, ordering, and supplement number, and supplements are cumulative; that is, a higher-numbered supplement includes the CIDs contained in lower- numbered supplements, as well as some additional CIDs. Consequently, text encoded according to the predefined CMaps for a given PDF version shall be valid when interpreted by a conforming reader supporting the same or a later PDF version. When interpreted by a conforming reader supporting an earlier PDF version, such text causes an error if a CMap is encountered that is not predefined for that PDF version. If character codes are encountered that were added in a higher-numbered supplement than the one corresponding to the supported PDF version, no characters are displayed for those codes; see [9.7.6.3], "Handling Undefined Characters".
    
    The Identity-H and Identity-V CMaps shall not be used with a non-embedded font. Only standardized character sets may be used.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 4"
    
        If a conforming writer producing a PDF file encounters text to be included that uses CIDs from a higher-numbered supplement than the one corresponding to the PDF version being generated, the application should embed the CMap for the higher-numbered supplement rather than refer to the predefined CMap.
    
    The CMap programs that define the predefined CMaps are available through the ASN Web site.


### 9.7.5.3 嵌入式 CMap 文件

**Embedded CMap Files**

=== "中文"

    For character encodings that are not predefined, the PDF file shall contain a stream that defines the CMap. In addition to the standard entries for streams (listed in [Table 5](../c7/s3.md#table5)), the CMap stream dictionary contains the entries listed in [Table 120](#table120). The data in the stream defines the mapping from character codes to a font number and a character selector. The data shall follow the syntax defined in Adobe Technical Note #5014, Adobe CMap and CIDFont Files Specification (see [bibliography](../bibliography.md)).

### 9.7.5.4 CMap 示例及操作符总结

**CMap Example and Operator Summary**

=== "中文"

    Embedded CMap files shall conform to the format documented in Adobe Technical Note #5014, subject to these additional constraints:
    
    a) If the embedded CMap file contains a usecmap reference, the CMap indicated there shall also be identified by the UseCMap entry in the CMap stream dictionary.
    
    b) The usefont operator, if present, shall specify a font number of 0.
    
    c) The beginbfchar and endbfchar shall not appear in a CMap that is used as the Encoding entry of a Type  font; however, they may appear in the definition of a ToUnicode CMap.
    
    d) A notdef mapping, defined using beginnotdefchar, endnotdefchar, beginnotdefrange, and endnotdefrange shall be used if the normal mapping produces a CID for which no glyph is present in the associated CIDFont.
    
    e) The beginrearrangedfont, endrearrangedfont, beginusematrix, and endusematrix operators shall not be used.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE"
    
        This example shows a sample CMap for a Japanese Shift-JIS encoding. Character codes in this encoding can be either 1 or 2 bytes in length. This CMap could be used with a CIDFont that uses the same CID ordering as specified in the **CIDSystemInfo** entry. Note that several of the entries in the stream dictionary are also replicated in the stream data.

### 9.7.6.2 CMap 映射

**CMap Mapping**

=== "中文"

    The **Encoding** entry of a Type 0 font dictionary specifies a CMap that specifies how text-showing operators (such as **Tj**) shall interpret the bytes in the string to be shown when the current font is the Type 0 font. This sub- clause describes how the characters in the string shall be decoded and mapped into character selectors, which in PDF are always CIDs.
    
    The codespace ranges in the CMap (delimited by **begincodespacerange** and **endcodespacerange**) specify how many bytes are extracted from the string for each successive character code. A codespace range shall be specified by a pair of codes of some particular length giving the lower and upper bounds of that range. A code shall be considered to match the range if it is the same length as the bounding codes and the value of each of its bytes lies between the corresponding bytes of the lower and upper bounds. The code length shall not be greater than 4.
    
    A sequence of one or more bytes shall be extracted from the string and matched against the codespace ranges in the CMap. That is, the first byte shall be matched against 1-byte codespace ranges; if no match is found, a second byte shall be extracted, and the 2-byte code shall be matched against 2-byte codespace ranges. This process continues for successively longer codes until a match is found or all codespace ranges have been tested. There will be at most one match because codespace ranges shall not overlap.
    
    The code extracted from the string shall be looked up in the character code mappings for codes of that length. (These are the mappings defined by **beginbfchar**, **endbfchar**, **begincidchar**, **endcidchar**, and corresponding operators for ranges.) Failing that, it shall be looked up in the notdef mappings, as described in the next sub- clause.
    
    The results of the CMap mapping algorithm are a font number and a character selector. The font number shall be used as an index into the Type 0 font’s **DescendantFonts** array to select a CIDFont. In PDF, the font number shall be 0 and the character selector shall be a CID; this is the only case described here. The CID shall then be used to select a glyph in the CIDFont. If the CIDFont contains no glyph for that CID, the notdef mappings shall be consulted, as described in [9.7.6.3], "Handling Undefined Characters".

### 9.7.6.3 处理未定义的字符

**Handling Undefined Characters**

=== "中文"

    A CMap mapping operation can fail to select a glyph for a variety of reasons. This sub-clause describes those reasons and what happens when they occur.
    
    If a code maps to a CID for which no such glyph exists in the descendant CIDFont, the notdef mappings in the CMap shall be consulted to obtain a substitute character selector. These mappings are delimited by the operators **beginnotdefchar**, **endnotdefchar**, **beginnotdefrange**, and **endnotdefrange** within an embedded CMap file. They shall always map to a CID. If a matching notdef mapping is found, the CID selects a glyph in the associated descendant, which shall be a CIDFont. If no glyph exists for that CID, the glyph for CID 0 (which shall be present) shall be substituted.
    
    !!! note "NOTE 5"
    
        *The notdef mappings are similar to the . notdef character mechanism in simple fonts.*
    
    If the CMap does not contain either a character mapping or a notdef mapping for the code, descendant 0 shall
    be selected and the glyph for CID 0 shall be substituted from the associated CIDFont.
    
    If the code is invalid—that is, the bytes extracted from the string to be shown do not match any codespace range in the CMap—a substitute glyph is chosen as just described. The character mapping algorithm shall be reset to its original position in the string, and a modified mapping algorithm chooses the best partially matching codespace range:
    
    a)If the first byte extracted from the string to be shown does not match the first byte of any codespace range, the range having the shortest codes shall be chosen.
    
    b)Otherwise (that is, if there is a partial match), for each additional byte extracted, the code accumulated so far shall be matched against the beginnings of all longer codespace ranges until the longest such partial match has been found. If multiple codespace ranges have partial matches of the same length, the one having the shortest codes shall be chosen.
    
    The length of the codes in the chosen codespace range determines the total number of bytes to consume from the string for the current mapping operation.
