**9.10 Extraction of Text Content**

## 9.10.1 概述

**9.10.1 General**

=== "中文"

    The preceding sub-clauses describe all the facilities for showing text and causing glyphs to be painted on the page. In addition to displaying text, conforming readers sometimes need to determine the information content of text—that is, its meaning according to some standard character identification as opposed to its rendered appearance. This need arises during operations such as searching, indexing, and exporting of text to other file formats.
    
    The Unicode standard defines a system for numbering all of the common characters used in a large number of languages. It is a suitable scheme for representing the information content of text, but not its appearance, since Unicode values identify characters, not glyphs. For information about Unicode, see the Unicode Standard by the Unicode Consortium (see the Bibliography).
    
    When extracting character content, a conforming reader can easily convert text to Unicode values if a font’s characters are identified according to a standard character set that is known to the conforming reader. This character identification can occur if either the font uses a standard named encoding or the characters in the font are identified by standard character names or CIDs in a well-known collection. [9.10.2], "Mapping Character Codes to Unicode Values", describes in detail the overall algorithm for mapping character codes to Unicode values.
    
    If a font is not defined in one of these ways, the glyphs can still be shown, but the characters cannot be converted to Unicode values without additional information:
    
    - This information can be provided as an optional **ToUnicode** entry in the font dictionary (PDF 1.2; see [9.10.3], "ToUnicode CMaps"), whose value shall be a stream object containing a special kind of CMap file that maps character codes to Unicode values.
    - An **ActualText** entry for a structure element or marked-content sequence (see [14.9.4], "Replacement Text") may be used to specify the text content directly.

## 9.10.2 将字符代码映射到 Unicode 值

**9.10.2 Mapping Character Codes to Unicode Values**

=== "中文"
    
    A conforming reader can use these methods, in the priority given, to map a character code to a Unicode value. Tagged PDF documents, in particular, shall provide at least one of these methods (see [14.8.2.4.2], "Unicode Mapping in Tagged PDF"):
    
    - If the font dictionary contains a **ToUnicode** CMap (see [9.10.3], "ToUnicode CMaps"), use that CMap to convert the character code to Unicode.
    - If the font is a simple font that uses one of the predefined encodings **MacRomanEncoding**,
    **MacExpertEncoding**, or **WinAnsiEncoding**, or that has an encoding whose **Differences** array includes only character names taken from the Adobe standard Latin character set and the set of named characters in the Symbol font (see [Annex D]):
    
        a) Map the character code to a character name according to Table D.1 and the font’s **Differences** array.
        
        b) Look up the character name in the Adobe Glyph List (see the [Bibliography](../bibliography.md)) to obtain the corresponding Unicode value.
    
    - If the font is a composite font that uses one of the predefined CMaps listed in [Table 118](./s7.md#table118) (except Identity–H and Identity–V) or whose descendant CIDFont uses the Adobe-GB1, Adobe-CNS1, Adobe-Japan1, or Adobe-Korea1 character collection:
    
    a) Map the character code to a character identifier (CID) according to the font’s CMap.
    
    b) Obtain the registry and ordering of the character collection used by the font’s CMap (for example, Adobe and Japan1) from its CIDSystemInfo dictionary.
    
    c) Construct a second CMap name by concatenating the registry and ordering obtained in step (b) in the format registry–ordering–UCS2 (for example, Adobe–Japan1–UCS2).
    
    d) Obtain the CMap with the name constructed in step (c) (available from the ASN Web site; see the [Bibliography](../bibliography.md)).
    
    e) Map the CID obtained in step (a) according to the CMap obtained in step (d), producing a Unicode value.
    
    !!! note "NOTE"
    
        Type 0 fonts whose descendant CIDFonts use the Adobe-GB1, Adobe-CNS1, Adobe-Japan1, or Adobe-Korea1 character collection (as specified in the **CIDSystemInfo** dictionary) shall have a supplement number corresponding to the version of PDF supported by the conforming reader. See [Table 3](./s7.md#table119) for a list of the character collections corresponding to a given PDF version. (Other supplements of these character collections can be used, but if the supplement is higher-numbered than the one corresponding to the supported PDF version, only the CIDs in the latter supplement are considered to be standard CIDs.)
    
    If these methods fail to produce a Unicode value, there is no way to determine what the character code represents in which case a conforming reader may choose a character code of their choosing.

## 9.10.3 ToUnicode CMaps

**9.10.3 ToUnicode CMaps**

=== "中文"

    The CMap defined in the **ToUnicode** entry of the font dictionary shall follow the syntax for CMaps introduced in [9.7.5], "CMaps" and fully documented in Adobe Technical Note #5014, Adobe CMap and CIDFont Files Specification. Additional guidance regarding the CMap defined in this entry is provided in Adobe Technical Note #5411, *ToUnicode Mapping File Tutorial*. This CMap differs from an ordinary one in these ways:
    
    - The only pertinent entry in the CMap stream dictionary (see [Table 120](./s7.md#table120)) is **UseCMap**, which may be used if the CMap is based on another **ToUnicode** CMap.
    - The CMap file shall contain **begincodespacerange** and **endcodespacerange** operators that are consistent with the encoding that the font uses. In particular, for a simple font, the codespace shall be one byte long.
    - It shall use the **beginbfchar**, **endbfchar**, **beginbfrange**, and **endbfrange** operators to define the mapping from character codes to Unicode character sequences expressed in UTF-16BE encoding.
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE 1"
    
        This example illustrates a Type 0 font that uses the Identity-H CMap to map from character codes to CIDs and whose descendant CIDFont uses the Identity mapping from CIDs to TrueType glyph indices. Text strings shown using this font simply use a 2-byte glyph index for each glyph. In the absence of a ToUnicode entry, no information would be available about what the glyphs mean.
        
        ```tex
        14 0 obj
            <<  /Type /Font
                /Subtype /Type0
                /BaseFont /Ryumin−Light
                /Encoding /Identity−H
                /DescendantFonts [ 15 0 R ]
                /ToUnicode 16 0 R
            >>
        endobj
        
        15 0 obj
            <<  /Type /Font
                /Subtype /CIDFontType2
                /BaseFont /Ryumin−Light
                /CIDSystemInfo 17 0 R
                /FontDescriptor 18 0 R
                /CIDToGIDMap /Identity
            >>
        endobj
        ```
    
    !!! info "EXAMPLE 2"
    
        In this example, the value of the ToUnicode entry is a stream object that contains the definition of the CMap.
    
        The **begincodespacerange** and **endcodespacerange** operators define the source character code range to be the 2-byte character codes from &lt;00 00&gt; to &lt;FF FF&gt;. The specific mappings for several of the character codes are shown.
        
        ```tex
        16 0 obj
            << /Length 433 >>
        stream
        /CIDInit /ProcSet findresource begin
        12 dict begin
        begincmap
        /CIDSystemInfo
        << /Registry ( Adobe )
        /Ordering ( UCS )
        /Supplement 0
        >> def
        /CMapName /Adobe−Identity−UCS def
        /CMapType 2 def
        1 begincodespacerange
        <0000>     <FFFF>
        endcodespacerange
        2 beginbfrange
        <0000>     <005E>    <0020>
        <005F>     <0061>    [ <00660066> <00660069> <00660066006C> ]
        endbfrange
        1 beginbfchar
        <3A51>     <D840DC3E>
        endbfchar
        endcmap
        CMapName currentdict /CMap defineresource pop
        end
        end
        endstream
        endobj
        ```
    
        &lt;00 00&gt; to &lt;00 5E&gt; are mapped to the Unicode values U+0020 to U+007E This is followed by the definition of a mapping where each character code represents more than one Unicode value:
        
        ```tex
        <005F> <0061> [ <00660066> <00660069> <00660066006C> ]
        ```
    
        In this case, the original character codes are the glyph indices for the ligatures ff, fi, and ffl. The entry defines the mapping from the character codes &lt;00 5F&gt;, &lt;00 60&gt;, and &lt;00 61&gt; to the strings of Unicode values with a Unicode scalar value for each character in the ligature: U+0066 U+0066 are the Unicode values for the character sequence f f, U+0066 U+0069 for f i, and U+0066 U+0066 U+006c for f f l.
    
        Finally, the character code &lt;3A 51&gt; is mapped to the Unicode value U+2003E, which is expressed by the byte sequence &lt;D840DC3E&gt; in UTF-16BE encoding.
    
    EXAMPLE 2 in this sub-clause illustrates several extensions to the way destination values may be defined. To support mappings from a source code to a string of destination codes, this extension has been made to the ranges defined after a **beginbfchar** operator:
    
    
    n **beginbfchar**<br/>
    srcCode dstString<br/>
    **endbfchar**<br/>
    
    
    where *dstString* may be a string of up to 512 bytes. Likewise, mappings after the **beginbfrange** operator may be defined as:
    
    n **beginbfrange**<br/>
    srcCode<sub>1</sub> srcCode<sub>2</sub> dstString<br/>
    **endbfrange**<br/>
    
    In this case, the last byte of the string shall be incremented for each consecutive code in the source code range.
    
    When defining ranges of this type, the value of the last byte in the string shall be less than or equal to 255 − (*srcCode2* − *srcCode1*). This ensures that the last byte of the string shall not be incremented past 255; otherwise, the result of mapping is undefined.
    
    To support more compact representations of mappings from a range of source character codes to a discontiguous range of destination codes, the CMaps used for the **ToUnicode** entry may use this syntax for the mappings following a **beginbfrange** definition.
    
    n **beginbfrange**<br/>
    srcCode<sub>1</sub> srcCode<sub>2</sub> [ dstString<sub>1</sub> dstString<sub>2</sub> … dstString<sub>m</sub> ]<br/>
    **endbfrange**<br/>
    
    Consecutive codes starting with *srcCode1* and ending with *srcCode2* shall be mapped to the destination strings in the array starting with *dstString1* and ending with dstStringm . The value of dstString can be a string of up to 512 bytes. The value of m represents the number of continuous character codes in the source character code range.
    
    $\text{m} = \text{srcCode}_2 - \text{srcCode}_1 + 1$
